Kody is your assistant's home—the memory, keys, code, and automations your AI
agent keeps, portable across every MCP host. Built on Cloudflare Workers and the
Model Context Protocol (MCP), it ships a Remix UI, Worker-based request routing,
package runtime plumbing, and OAuth-protected MCP endpoints. The project favors
a compact MCP surface with powerful `search` and Code Mode `execute` flows over
a large static tool catalog.

Kody is a multi-user personal assistant: each signed-in user gets a fully
isolated assistant (packages, jobs, secrets, memories, and related state). Tests
and fixtures may seed deterministic local accounts, but no account is privileged
at runtime. The repo follows several
[epicflare](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epicflare) starter conventions.

The repo is organized as an Nx monorepo, with shared modules in
`packages/shared` (`@kody-internal/shared`), the origin app worker under
`packages/worker`, sibling workers under `packages/platform-worker`,
`packages/runtime-worker`, and `packages/jobs-worker`, and mock Workers under
`packages/mock-servers/*`. Production topology lives in
[`docs/contributing/architecture/index.md`](./docs/contributing/architecture/index.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at `localhost:3742` by default (the CLI picks the next free
port and prints the resolved URL). Wrangler handles the local Cloudflare Workers
runtime and D1 database automatically.

To scaffold a **new** project from the epicflare template instead, run
`npx create-epicflare`.

See
[`docs/contributing/getting-started.md`](./docs/contributing/getting-started.md)
for the full setup paths and expectations. Contributors and agents should start
with [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for repo-specific guidance.

## Scope

- Fair Source personal assistant platform, not a general-purpose agent harness
- MCP-first architecture intended to work across compatible AI agent hosts
- Compact MCP surface area preferred over a large static tool inventory
- ChatGPT is a likely primary host target, while keeping the server usable from
  other MCP hosts where practical

## How It Works

```
kody.codes  → kody-production (origin: Remix, /mcp HTTP, OAuth, email, queues)
                 ├─→ kody-platform  (MCP / mailbox / meter / repo-session DOs)
                 ├─→ kody-runtime   (package apps, invoke API, StorageRunner)
                 └─→ kody-jobs      (cron + JobManager; calls back via JobsHost)

kody.run    → kody-runtime (package-app zone routes)
```

- `packages/worker/src/index.ts` is the origin entrypoint; platform, runtime,
  and jobs have sibling entrypoints (see
  [architecture](./docs/contributing/architecture/index.md#production-worker-fleet))
- OAuth requests are handled first, then MCP requests, then static assets
- Non-asset requests fall through to the server handler and router
- Client assets are bundled into `packages/worker/public/` and served via the
  `ASSETS` binding
