/**
 * Reloads a Worker environment's whole module graph when an HMR update touches
 * a component module, instead of letting Vite hot-swap it in place.
 *
 * Under `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` the virtual worker entry is a self-accepting
 * HMR boundary, so a change never dead-ends into Vite's own full reload: the
 * module runner re-imports the nearest boundary and re-evaluates only the
 * invalidated importer chain, while every module off that chain keeps its
 * state. `remix/component-hmr` also instruments every component module into its own
 * boundary. Both are fine for a browser tab and wrong for SSR: each evaluation
 * of a component module mints new component functions, and Remix keys
 * `handle.context` on component identity. A request rendered during the
 * multi-stage cascade Remix's component HMR produces (update → invalidate →
 * importer update → circular reload) mixed generations, `context.get()` came
 * back `undefined`, and SSR failed part-way through the document.
 *
 * So when the changed modules or any of their importers (up to the entry) are
 * such a boundary, this sends `full-reload`: the runner clears its evaluated
 * modules and re-imports the entry — one consistent graph per change, the same
 * model as a redeploy. Pure server chains (a handler, a data loader) have no
 * component identities to split and keep Vite's cheaper incremental update;
 * module-level side effects on that path must be idempotent (see
 * `registerFrame`). The client environment is untouched, so browser component
 * HMR keeps hot-swapping, and client-only files never reach a Worker
 * environment's `hotUpdate` with modules.
