# Startup bundle measured notes

Append-only ledger of reviewed `maxEntryBytes` bumps. Live ceilings live in
`tools/worker-startup-bundle-budget.json`. Append a new measurement here; do not
re-flow older notes when you bump a number.

Byte overages no longer fail CI: `tools/check-worker-startup-bundles.ts` warns
and upserts a tracking GitHub issue on main pushes. Keep this ledger honest when
you intentionally raise a ceiling.

## origin

Vite production entry. Reviewed ceiling 7_750_000.

## platform

Waiting first-use probes (search, memory, execute, package, job, integration,
secret, Discord membership) ship on platform because waitingSummary runs in the
MCP Durable Object. UserMeter schema v12 inbound MCP last-used RPCs add a few KB
(CI dry-run 4_992_191). Keep last-used on this class; do not add a second DO.

- Package-app `kody.app.client` browser bundling and `/_assets/*` serving
  (publish rebuild and packageAppFetch both run here) add ~12 KB on top: local
  dry-run 5_004_707 bytes.
- emailDestination list/add/set-default/remove plus emailSend destination
  resolution add ~23 KB: local dry-run 5_028_263 bytes.
- MCP OAuth token-recovery persist/stamp on McpClientHub (refresh before wipe,
  durable last_error when a previously-ready server parks authenticating) adds
  ~2 KB: CI dry-run 5_036_978 bytes.
- Package publish stamps identity-icon derivatives from
  finalizePublishedEntitySource: local dry-run 5_046_681 bytes.
- MCP connection-event ack-by-id plus last_error keep-until-ready on
  McpClientHub: CI dry-run 5_050_804 bytes.
- MCP OAuth sidecar refresh-token preserve (merge omitted RT, restore when
  client_id missing, remint/invalidate delete sidecar, nested discovery refresh
  advertising): CI dry-run 5_063_749 bytes.
- Provider-secret placeholders on the shared fetch-gateway path (bindings,
  grants, sealed resolve) plus the MCP OAuth sidecar preserve: local dry-run
  5_088_887 bytes.
- Search package export headings (`package:{id}#{subpath}`) add a few hundred
  bytes: local dry-run 5_095_156 bytes.

  user-secret read): local dry-run 5_096_278 bytes.

  on the shared add/resend path: local dry-run 5_097_119 bytes.
- Flag-gated Jev search experiment (`jev-search-rerank` registry entry plus
  shared search list wiring) spilled ~5 KB into the platform entry: CI measured
  5_102_980 bytes against the previous 5_098_000 budget.
- List-mode search `serverTiming` (execute-shaped `{ name, durationMs }`
  including `jevRerank`) adds a few hundred bytes: CI dry-run 5_105_268 against
  the previous 5_105_000 budget.
- Jev Score question batching (merge/parse plus expected/received errorReason)
  adds a few hundred bytes on top of that wiring.
- Per-user MCP/meta search abuse rate limits (burst + daily D1 checkRateLimit
  before embeddings/Jev, not an entitlement) add ~2 KB: local dry-run 5_112_004
  against the previous 5_110_000 budget.
- First-pass package export candidates (`package:{id}#{subpath}` promotion +
  bounded hydrate) add a few KB on top of that wiring: prior CI dry-run
  5_112_939 against 5_110_000 before the rate-limit bump; keep headroom for
  both.

  platform: CI/local dry-run 5_120_066 against the previous 5_118_000 budget.
- Search list dual-channel parity (markdown carries the same actionable
  export-contract / next-step / notices substance as structured): CI dry-run

  passthrough) spilled ~3 KB into the platform entry: CI dry-run 5_133_007
  against the previous 5_130_000 budget.
- File fragment anchors (`#L165`, `#L165-L180`, markdown heading slugs) on
  search entity, repoReadFile, and package file open pull line-anchor and
  file-anchor into platform: registers search, and esbuild keeps the lazy
  repo/coding domains in this same entry, so line-anchor and file-anchor cannot
  stay on runtime alone. CI dry-run 5_145_618 against the previous 5_135_000

## runtime

Listing-only helpers live in the shared secrets service module
(resolveSecretListScopeOrder / listSecretBucketsByScope). Runtime does not call
them, but they sit in the same module as resolve and add a few KB. Share-grant
import/storage routing added more. secretJwtSign JWA families (HMAC/PSS/ES plus
extra RSA hashes) add ~0.5KB. Split listing out of service.ts or the share-grant
runtime path if this budget is raised again.

- Package-app `/_assets/*` serving (fingerprinted client module, static assets
  directory) runs here: local dry-run 3_701_307 bytes. Package-app runtime
  (mounted-URL dispatch in the wrapper source and runtime resolution) adds ~11
  KB: local dry-run 3_712_214 bytes.

  shared outbound send path: local dry-run 3_725_245 bytes.

  secret-providers/service.ts into runtime: CI dry-run 3_768_307 bytes against
  the previous 3_745_000 budget.

  KB: CI dry-run 3_798_379 against the previous 3_795_000 budget.
- Feature-flag `experiments_opt_in` audience (users.experiments_opt_in batch
  read + gate) measured ~1.3 KB on the prior base (CI dry-run 3_796_324); fits
  within this headroom after the paid-Jev bump.
- Export parent-identity fold, close top-K promotion, and adaptive Jev keep

  resolver, package-invocation 403 mapping, realtime connect, per-hook, and
  emit/broadcast checks, pre-ledger invoke check, non-retryable workflow step)
  adds ~1.1 KB on top: local dry-run 3_824_132 against the previous 3_824_000

  capability errors (per-call secret redactor) from generic platform failures
  adds about 870 more: local dry-run 5_277_132 (5_277_389 with #2764), reviewed
  ceiling 5_277_500.
- Startup byte overages no longer fail Static / block Deploy: the checker warns
  and upserts a deduped GitHub tracking issue on main CI pushes instead.
- Drop unused Zod v4 locale barrels from Worker bundles
  (`patches/zod+4.6.5.patch`): `zod/v4/classic/external.js` re-exports
  `../locales/index.js`, which previously pulled ~50 locale modules into every
  Worker that imports `zod`. Kody only applies English via that classic entry.
  Local dry-run runtime 3_720_975 against the previous 3_914_000 budget (closes
  #2819 overage), reviewed ceiling 3_722_000; platform 5_107_102 against the
  previous 5_277_500 budget (also clears #2811), reviewed ceiling 5_108_000.
  Origin Vite entry unchanged at 3_480_403.
- Local-execute inlined-CAF rewrite + CapabilityProxy shim source builders
  (#2830) deferred to `local-execute-runtime-support.mjs` additional module
  (same lane as oauth-provider / worker-bundler) so platform main no longer
  carries those templates or the rewrite AST walk. Clears #2831 overage
  (measured 5_123_062). Local dry-run platform 5_104_954 against the previous
  5_108_000 budget, reviewed ceiling 5_106_000.
