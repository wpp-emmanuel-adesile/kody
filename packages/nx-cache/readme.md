# kody Nx remote cache

Self-hosted Nx HTTP remote cache for this repository. Agents and GitHub Actions
share task artifacts so CI does not rerun work the agent already completed.

The worker implements the
[Nx self-hosted cache OpenAPI spec](https://nx.dev/docs/kb/self-hosted-caching):
`GET`/`PUT /v1/cache/{hash}` with bearer auth, `409` on overwrite, `403` when a
read-only token PUTs, and artifacts stored in R2. `neverConnectToCloud` stays on
so Nx does not prompt for Nx Cloud. Same-repo validate and Cloud Agent
environments use the write token. Fork `pull_request` jobs use the read token.

Public URL: `https://nx-cache.kody.codes`.

## Clients

Nx always reads `NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The value is the
write token on trusted writers (Cloud Agent environments and same-repo validate)
and the read token on fork `pull_request` validate
(`NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_READ_TOKEN`).

```bash
export NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_SERVER=https://nx-cache.kody.codes
export NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_ACCESS_TOKEN="<write-or-read-token>"
```

Leave them unset to run with the local `.nx` cache only. Validate and
`test:push` use `CI=1` so cache hashes match GitHub Actions (`CI=true` would
miss). On Cloud Agent VMs, `npm run hooks:ensure` composes Husky through
Cursor's hook dispatcher so `git push` runs `test:push` when the push includes a
non-docs path, and can upload those artifacts before CI starts. Docs-only pushes
skip `test:push`. GitHub Actions only sets the server URL after `GET /health`
succeeds and an authorized `GET /v1/cache/{hash}` returns 200 or 404 — Nx fails
the job if the host is configured but unreachable or unauthorized, so validate
can still pass before the worker exists or after a token rotation that has not
been synced yet. Cached npm scripts (`test:node`, `test:workers`,
`test:e2e:run`, `test:mcp`, `test`, and `worker:typecheck`) run through
`tools/run-nx.ts`. A transport error talking to `/v1/cache/{hash}` after Nx
already printed `Successfully ran target` is treated as success. The same
transport error before tasks finish retries once with `--skipRemoteCache` and
without `NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_SERVER`. Unauthorized or
misconfigured-cache errors still fail.

`npm run nx-cache:smoke` (also part of `test:node`) starts a local HTTP cache,
runs `nx-cache:smoke-probe` twice with an isolated local cache wiped in between,
and asserts the second run is a `[remote cache]` hit that restores outputs
without re-running the command.

## Retention

R2 expires `v1/` objects 14 days after they are written and aborts incomplete
multipart uploads after 1 day. Production deploy reapplies that lifecycle when
it ensures the bucket. First PUT wins (`409` on overwrite), so expiry is also
the window after which a poisoned hash can be replaced.

## Deploy

Production deploy (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) creates the `kody-nx-cache`
R2 bucket, applies the 14-day lifecycle, uploads the worker, and syncs
`CACHE_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `CACHE_READ_TOKEN` from the matching GitHub Actions
secrets when cache-related paths change or when that workflow is dispatched on
`main`. The job no-ops when the write secret is missing so a first merge does
not block production.

To redeploy only the cache worker (for example after rotating either token), run
**Actions → 🧊 Nx cache worker → Run workflow** on `main`
(`.github/workflows/nx-cache-deploy.yml`). That reuses the same job and does not
cancel an in-progress production deploy.
