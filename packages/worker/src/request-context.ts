 * Server-Timing entries recorded along the way.
 *
 * The context travels two ways. `AsyncLocalStorage` propagates it through the
 * awaits between `handleRequest` and code that has no `Request` in hand (the
 * repo layer). SSR frames render while the response body streams, which can
 * be after the storage scope has exited, so the same context is also keyed by
 * `Request` and callers that hold the request pass it explicitly.
