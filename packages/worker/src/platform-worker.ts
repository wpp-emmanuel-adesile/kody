/**
 * Platform Worker entrypoint (script `kody-platform`, deployed from
 * `packages/platform-worker/wrangler.jsonc`).
 *
 * Owns the remaining platform Durable Objects extracted from the origin
 * `kody` Worker per ADR 0034 so content/UI deploys of the origin script do
 * not reset those objects. HTTP on this script is the deploy healthcheck
 * only; MCP HTTP, OAuth, email, and the Remix app stay on the origin and
 * reach these classes through cross-script bindings.
 *
 * `KodyFetchGateway` and `PackageAppRuntimeBridge` are loopback
 * `ctx.exports` WorkerEntrypoints. MCP `execute` (and the search/execute
 * graph that fans into it) runs inside the platform-owned `MCP` Durable
 * Object and looks up those exports on **this** script, the same way
 * `kody-runtime` exports its own gateway instead of calling back into origin.
