/**
 * Why MCP auth denials go to the audit log instead of Sentry.
 *
 * A single denial is a conversation turn: an agent calls something it is not
 * allowed to call, reads the message, and corrects itself. Reporting each one
 * as an error creates issues that look like platform bugs. But this is also the
 * only place we would see a token being replayed or a principal walking the
 * capability surface, so dropping them outright trades noise for a blind spot.
 *
 * The audit log already resolves that tension for browser and OAuth sign-in
 * failures: identifiers are hashed, rows keep for 180 days, admins can query
 * them, and `/admin/insights` charts failures per day and per hour. Recording
 * denials there keeps the error stream clean while a burst still shows up as a
 * spike on a chart that already exists.
 *
 * Only denials that resolve to a principal are recorded. Anonymous rejections
 * are reachable by anyone and would let a stranger drive unbounded writes, so
 * `/mcp` deliberately drops them rather than auditing them.
