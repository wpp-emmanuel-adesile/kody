 * Waits for the renderer's first chunk before handing back a body stream.
 *
 * `renderToStream` resolves the whole document before it enqueues anything, so
 * a component that throws during render errors the stream before its first
 * chunk. Reading that chunk here turns such a failure into a rejection the
 * caller can answer with a real error response, instead of a committed `200`
 * whose body stops after the doctype (which the browser shows as a blank page
 * and shared caches can store). The remix/component renderer also emits markup
 * starting at `<html>`; without a doctype the browser parses the document in
 * quirks mode, so the doctype is prepended once the document is known to exist.
