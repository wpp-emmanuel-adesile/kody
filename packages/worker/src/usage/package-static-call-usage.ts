 * exports (see `__kodyMeterStaticPackageExport` in
 * `packages/worker/src/package-runtime/runtime-source-modules.ts`).
 *
 * Trust model: the callee package id is stamped into generated import-proxy
 * code by the bundler, never taken from author-supplied strings. Generated
 * code still runs inside the sandbox realm, though, so the host validates
 * every reported id against the bundle's *direct* static dependency package ids
 * recorded at build time (a strict subset of the `packageStorage()` grant
 * set, which additionally grants the run's own package id and
 * dynamic-import dependencies) and silently drops anything else. A
 * malicious module can therefore at worst inflate call counts for packages
 * its own bundle already statically depends on — it can never attribute
 * usage to an arbitrary package.
 *
 * Events arrive as one batch per run (buffered sandbox-side and flushed by
 * the run wrapper while the sandbox RPC dispatchers are still live); each
 * batch entry becomes one usage event. `record` never throws and never
 * rejects: metering must not break the call path it observes (same
 * contract as `recordUsage`).
