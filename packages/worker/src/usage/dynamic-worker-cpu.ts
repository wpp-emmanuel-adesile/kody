 * recording here adds no latency to the run. `cpuTime` is Cloudflare's own
 * per-invocation CPU measurement; wall time is never used as a CPU stand-in.
 * Props are identity only: `LOADER.get` keeps the first factory's WorkerCode
 * for a cache id, and the id already hashes the user. Zero CPU is still
 * recorded, so `event_count` doubles as tail delivery coverage against
 * `dynamic_worker_invoke` (tails are best-effort). `outcome` is the isolate's
 * platform outcome (`exceededCpu`, `exception`, …), not the sandbox result:
 * user code errors are caught inside `evaluate` and still trace as `ok`.
