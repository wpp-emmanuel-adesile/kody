/**
 * Closed surface tags for unique Dynamic Worker day (UWD) attribution.
 *
 * Cloudflare bills unique Dynamic Worker ids per UTC day. The `execute`
 * usage metric is MCP-execute-only, and jobs already emit `job_run`; UWD
 * itself had no surface. Every LOADER mint records this tag on the
 * `dynamic_worker_day` usage event so Analytics Engine can break the
 * month down by surface.
 *
 * `package_export` is the usage-metering name for run-record surface
 * `export`. Fail closed to `unknown` only when no run surface or package
 * context is available.
