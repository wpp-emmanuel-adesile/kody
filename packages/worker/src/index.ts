/**
 * Dev/test origin entry. `env.test` (local dev, workers-unit, Playwright)
 * inherits this top-level `main`: it has no separate platform/runtime/jobs
 * scripts, so this single script owns every Durable Object and
 * `ctx.exports` WorkerEntrypoint locally (no `script_name` on any binding).
 *
 * Deployed environments use the slimmer `production-worker.ts` entry from a
 * deploy-generated Wrangler config:
 *
 * - Production (`tools/ci/production-resources.ts`) only when the origin
 *   script is already in steady state (platform/runtime own the transferred
 *   classes). A fresh production script still deploys this full entry first
 *   so `new_sqlite_classes` can replay before the transfer.
 * - Preview (`tools/ci/preview-resources.ts`) always: the per-PR platform
 *   and runtime scripts create their own classes, so the preview origin
 *   never owns one and never bootstraps. This full entry is only the
 *   fallback for a preview origin created before that topology that still
 *   owns transferred classes.
 *
 * See `tools/ci/origin-production-deploy-state.ts`.
