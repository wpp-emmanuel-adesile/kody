/**
 * Lazy access to the runtime worker bundler, loaded from pre-bundled modules
 * in `./node_modules/.kody-generated/` (built by
 * `tools/build-worker-bundler-modules.ts` into `packages/worker/.generated/`
 * and hardlinked here).
 *
 * Importing `@cloudflare/worker-bundler` directly — even via dynamic
 * `import()` — gets inlined into the single main worker module by wrangler,
 * which put ~3.6 MB of bundler/TypeScript compiler into every isolate cold
 * start. The generated `.mjs` files stay behind `import()` so Vite origin
 * emits them as hashed SSR chunks and Wrangler sibling workers still match
 * the `find_additional_modules` rule in their `wrangler.jsonc`. Either way
 * they only load and evaluate when repo checks actually run.
 *
 * The `node_modules/` prefix is load-bearing: wrangler's additional-module
 * walker discovers these files under `src/`, but its directory watcher skips
 * `node_modules`. `wrangler-env.ts` also clears that collector's esbuild
 * `watchFiles` / `watchDirs` so overlay-FS create events do not retrigger
 * `wrangler dev` (Friction #1789).
