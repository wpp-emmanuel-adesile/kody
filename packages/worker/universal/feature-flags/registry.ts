/**
 * Typed registry of feature flags. Flags are created and removed only via
 * code review by editing `featureFlagDefinitions`. The database stores
 * runtime state (global toggles/rollouts and per-user overrides), not which
 * flags exist. Removing a key from this array leaves any leftover DB rows
 * visible as "stale" in the admin UI until an operator deletes them.
 *
 * Flags should declare a `successMetric`: the usage metric the flag is
 * expected to move, reviewed in the same PR that creates the flag. Flags
 * with one get exposure recording and an on/off cohort readout on the admin
 * surfaces (see `docs/contributing/architecture/feature-flags.md`). Optional
 * `exposureRecording` selects the write site (`evaluation` chokepoints by
 * default, or `paid-ranked-search` for the Jev experiment frame). The
 * `successMetric` field stays optional for flags that are genuinely
 * unmeasurable (such as the permanent `demo-indicator`), and the admin UI and
 * MCP list surface a notice strongly recommending one everywhere else.
