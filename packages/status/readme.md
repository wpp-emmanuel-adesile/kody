# kody status worker

The public status page for kody, served at
[status.kody.codes](https://status.kody.codes). It is deliberately a separate
Cloudflare Worker with its own storage so it stays up when the main worker's
deploys, code, or database are broken (see decision record 0004).

## How it works

- A cron trigger runs one probe pass per minute:
  - `GET /health` and `GET /health/components` on the primary origin
    (`kody.codes`)
  - the unauthenticated OAuth challenge on `/mcp`
  - package-runtime liveness `GET /__runtime/health` on `kody.run` (JSON
    `status: "ok"`; an apex 302 is not up)
  - jobs-worker `GET /health` and `GET /health/components` over a service
    binding (no public jobs hostname; JOBS_DB rides on the Jobs component)
  -     MCP execute evidence: a successful authenticated execute completion in the
    previous minute (read cheaply from `/health/components`) skips a synthetic.
    Otherwise the worker runs at most one authenticated
    `POST /__maintenance/mcp-execute-health` per rolling hour. Failed attempts
    consume that budget. Public `/` and `/status.json` never trigger that
    execute. When the Durable Object's last-success timestamp is already outside
    the one-minute skip window, those public reads refresh `executeEvidence`
    from origin `GET /health/components` (same cheap timestamp-only field the
    cron uses; a down origin fails open to stored state; persist and cron
    synthetic writes merge with any newer timestamp written during those
    fetches). The public card treats organic or synthetic success in the last
    hour as recently verified — organic traffic alone keeps the card green; the
    hourly synthetic is an optional fallback when traffic is quiet. Missing or
    stale telemetry is unknown, not an outage, and does not change overall
    status or hide other incidents.
- Public storage cards are the main-worker bindings that take the product down
  (`app_db`, `kv`, `assets`). Operator `GET /health/components` reports
  `audit_db` as well; it is not a public card and does not open incidents or
  send alert email.
- A single `StatusStore` Durable Object (SQLite) stores per-minute samples (24
  h), daily uptime rollups (90 days), incidents, and sent notifications.
- A component opens an incident after two consecutive probe failures and
  resolves it after two consecutive successes.
- Day bars and the uptime percentage follow those opened incidents. Isolated
  probe failures below the threshold stay in the 24h sample log only — they do
  not increment daily failed counts or paint a day amber. A day turns amber when
  an incident covered it for under an hour and under 5% of that day's probes
  failed; red when the incident lasted an hour or more, or at least 5% of probes
  failed. Cards start at the first day with samples instead of padding empty
  leading days.
- Operator alert emails go to `ALERT_EMAIL_TO` through the Cloudflare Email REST
  API: one email when an outage starts, at most one reminder per day while it
  lasts, one all-clear when everything has recovered, all under a daily cap
  (`STATUS_ALERT_DAILY_LIMIT`). Alert links use `STATUS_PAGE_URL`
  (`https://status.kody.codes`).

When an incident opens or resolves, the worker also POSTs a small JSON payload
to the main worker (`POST /__maintenance/status-incidents`) when the shared
Worker secret `STATUS_INCIDENT_EVENT_SECRET` is set. That path fans
`status.incident.opened` / `status.incident.resolved` to admin package
subscriptions. The notify is fire-and-forget with a short timeout so a down or
missing secret cannot stall probes or email. When the secret is unset, packages
can reconcile from `GET /status.json`.

Resolved incidents may also carry an optional operator retrospective (what
happened, impact, timeline, cause, what we did, what we will change). Probes
remain the source of truth for open vs resolved. The writeup is attached
narrative, stored on `StatusStore`, and shown on the public page inside a
`<details>` block so the incident list stays glanceable. `/status.json` includes
`retrospective` on each incident (`null` when none is published).

Publish or replace a writeup with a bearer POST to the status worker itself —
not origin — so a down main worker cannot block it:

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST \
  "https://status.kody.codes/__maintenance/incidents/10/retrospective" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $STATUS_INCIDENT_EVENT_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data @packages/status/retrospectives/jobs-2026-09-02.json
```

`STATUS_INCIDENT_EVENT_SECRET` is the same Worker secret already synced from
GitHub Actions. When it is unset, the route returns 503. Open incidents return
409; unknown ids return 404. There is no public unauthenticated write.

The 2026-09-02 Jobs incident payload lives at
`packages/status/retrospectives/jobs-2026-09-02.json` (status incident id 10).

## Provider incidents (Cloudflare)

Each cron tick also fetches Cloudflare's public Statuspage feed
(`incidents/unresolved.json`, no auth, short timeout) and caches a filtered
subset in the Durable Object (~60s refresh, stale-tolerant for a few minutes).
Only incidents whose affected components intersect products kody runs on are
kept: Workers, D1, R2, Workers KV, Durable Objects, Queues, Vectorize, Email
Routing, and Access. Regional PoPs, Stream, Magic Transit, and other unrelated
products are dropped.

When that filtered list is non-empty, the status page renders a clearly
separated **Provider incidents (Cloudflare)** section. It is provider-declared
context only — never merged into kody's measured health or uptime numbers. If
the Statuspage API is slow or unreachable, the page omits the section (fail
soft). Outage alert emails get one annotation line per active relevant incident
(`Possibly related Cloudflare incident: …`); alerts are never gated or
suppressed based on provider status.

## Routes

| Path                                              | Purpose                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                                               | Public status page (HTML)                                                       |
| `/status.json`                                    | Snapshot as JSON                                                                |
| `POST /__maintenance/incidents/:id/retrospective` | Operator writeup on a resolved incident (bearer `STATUS_INCIDENT_EVENT_SECRET`) |
| `/health`                                         | Liveness for the status worker itself                                           |
| `/favicon-operational.png`                        | Favicon when all measured components are up                                     |
| `/favicon-down.png`                               | Favicon while a kody incident is open                                           |
| `/favicon-unknown.png`                            | Favicon when status data is unavailable                                         |
| `/favicon.ico`                                    | 302 to the current overall-status PNG (30s cache)                               |

The HTML `<link rel="icon">` (and apple-touch icon) is chosen from
`overallStatus` on each render. The page meta-refreshes every 60 seconds, so an
open tab picks up a new icon when an incident opens or resolves. `/favicon.ico`
follows the same snapshot so clients that ignore `<link>` tags stay in sync.
Provider incidents do not change the favicon — they stay corroborating context
only.

## Deploy

Deployed by `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (path-filtered job, like the backup
control plane) with `npm run status:deploy`. The `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` Worker
secret (Email Sending permission) is synced at deploy time; without it, alert
emails are skipped and logged.

Wrangler attaches `status.kody.codes` as a custom domain. The deploy healthcheck
probes that host's `/health`. Other component probes do not depend on the status
hostname.
