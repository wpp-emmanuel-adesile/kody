# Packages

Repo-backed saved packages: list, detail, files, share, approve-publish.

## How to get there

`/@username` lists your repositories (saved packages), including private and
unpublished ones when you view your own profile. The page heading and account
rail label are **Repositories**; routes stay `/@username` and
`/account/packages`. Chip filters (`visibility`, `listing`, `hidden`, `package`,
`app`) and sort (`sort=updated|created|name`, `dir=asc|desc`) run client-side
from the already-loaded list (behind a `<details>` Filters disclosure; no
loader, no view transition). Default sort is updated descending
(`updated_at DESC`); name defaults to ascending. `package=yes|no` is whether the
row has the saved-package extension — distinct from `app=yes|no` (Has app / No
app). Own-profile GET params: `visibility=public|private`,
`listing=published|unpublished|ahead` (ahead = **Needs republish**: the listing
pin is behind `published_commit`, not HEAD-ahead-of-published), `hidden=yes|no`,
`package=yes|no`, `app=yes|no`, `sort=created|name`, and `dir=asc|desc` (omit
`dir` when it matches the sort field's default). Guests can use
`listing=published|unpublished`, `package=yes|no`, `app=yes|no`, `sort`, and
`dir`. Owner-only params are ignored for them. Search is `q=` and filters the
already-loaded list as you type (URL `replaceState`, no loader). Each row shows
Iconic signifiers (native tooltip only) for package, private, hidden, published
to Community or not published to Community, webhook count, job count, and
whether it has an app. Private repositories do not also get a “not published to
Community” signifier — the private icon is enough. List marks come from
`/@username/:kodyId/icon/:iconCommit` (packages) and
`/account/repos/:repoId/icon/:iconCommit` (owner-only plain repos). Each package
lives at `/@username/:kodyId` (the URL slug is the package name leaf; **Repo**
tab: description, tags, license, badges), `/@username/:kodyId/tree/:ref`
(**Files** tab), `/@username/:kodyId/assets/…` (README-relative images from the
published or pinned commit), `/@username/:kodyId/settings` (**Settings** tab:
lock, visibility, share, webhooks, delete), `/@username/:kodyId/approve-publish`
(published-vs-HEAD review), and `/@username/:kodyId/approve-changes` (guest
pin-ahead published diff). Opening an allowlisted image or video in the tree
renders a preview; the bytes come from `/@username/:kodyId/raw/:ref/…` (same
authz as the tree). Legacy `/account/packages` HTML URLs only redirect to these
canonical pages.

## Drive it

Preview seed has **no** packages until you create one. Package creation is
MCP-only (`packageGetGitRemote({ create: true, kody_id })` with the package name
leaf or `@owner/leaf`). There is no create action on
`POST /account/packages.json`. Use the CLI — logged-in preview testing does not
require agents to hand-roll an MCP OAuth dance — the CLI does it for them:

```bash
npm run control-kody -- package-create --origin <preview> --package-name <leaf-or-@scope/leaf> [--head-ahead]
```

Then assert the pages:

```bash
node tools/control-kody.ts preview -- \
  --request 'GET /account/packages.json' \
  --check /@user-me
```

`--head-ahead` pushes one unpublished commit so the Repo tab can show **HEAD
ahead of published**. That flag needs a minted Artifacts write remote.
`--kody-id` is an alias for `--package-name`. To prove delete, create a package
with `package-create`, then delete it and assert the empty state. Arbitrary MCP
fixtures use `control-kody execute` / `search` against the same origin.

## APIs

- `GET|POST /account/packages.json` (list / token actions; no package-create
  action)
- `GET /profiles/:username/packages/:kodyId.json`
- `GET /profiles/:username/packages/:kodyId/files.json`
- `GET /@:username/:kodyId/icon/:iconCommit` (package list mark)
- `GET /account/repos/:repoId/icon/:iconCommit` (owner-only repo list mark)
- `GET /@:username/:kodyId/raw/:ref(/*relativePath)` (allowlisted media bytes)
- `GET /profiles/:username/packages/:kodyId/approve-publish.json`
- `GET|POST /profiles/:username/packages/:kodyId/share.json`
- `GET|POST /profiles/:username/packages/:kodyId/approve-changes.json`
- `GET /account/packages/:packageId/files.json` (404 + `redirectTo` the tree)
- `GET|POST /account/packages/:packageId/approve-publish.json`

## Gotchas

- Stay on the preview origin. Do not follow a package-app handoff into
  production.
- Unlocking a locked package is website-only.
- Making a package public or private requires typing the slug. Going public also
  asks the owner to skim source, README, and examples for personal details
  first. Agents review that hygiene before `packageUpdate`
  `changes.visibility: "public"`; they pass `confirm_name` only when going
  private.
- Invocation-token JSON actions on `POST /account/packages.json` are an
  unadvertised operator drain. Settings does not show token forms.
- When default-branch HEAD is newer than the last publish, the Repo tab shows
  **HEAD ahead of published**. Owners click that badge to review the diff and
  publish HEAD on `/@username/:kodyId/approve-publish`. Publish checks require
  non-empty root `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
- Owners and accepted shares see **Open Package App** on the package page when
  the package declares an app. Guests do not.
- Own-profile **Needs republish** (`listing=ahead`) is listing pin behind
  `published_commit`. It is not HEAD-ahead-of-published and not `updated_at`
  after `published_at` (community publish bumps that timestamp even when the pin
  already matches).
