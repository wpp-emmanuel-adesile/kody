# Public marketing pages

Public homepage (session-aware CTAs), pricing, FAQ, case studies, support,
legal, docs, blog, Discord invite.

## How to get there

`/`, `/pricing`, `/faq`, `/case-studies`, `/support`, `/privacy`, `/terms`,
`/docs`, `/docs/:slug`, `/docs/connect`, `/llms.txt`, `/blog`, `/blog/:slug`,
`/discord`. Legacy `/guides*` URLs 308 to `/docs*`. Intra-docs navigation (doc
to doc, or a doc to `/docs` / `/docs/connect`) is an instant shell swap — no
page view-transition — so the sidebar does not re-animate. How Kody works (and
other interactive walkthroughs) stay in the article column; they do not break
out over the nav. The docs shell opts out of overflow anchoring so replacing the
article does not bump the rail. After hydrate it independently prefetches every
sidebar href (one loader request per slug, including `/docs/connect`) so a click
adopts a warm payload instead of waiting on a cold fetch.
`/docs/package-sharing` opens with a flag callout: signed-in visitors POST
`/docs/package-sharing/opt-in` to turn `package-share-grants` on for themselves;
signed-out visitors log in with `redirectTo` back to that page. Custom secret
providers are documented at `/docs/secret-providers`. Open API is documented at
`/docs/open-api`; local CLI execute at `/docs/local-execute`.

## Drive it

```bash
node tools/control-kody.ts health --origin https://kody.codes
node tools/control-kody.ts request GET /docs.json --skip-login --origin https://kody.codes
```

Anonymous HTML on `/` and several marketing routes is short-CDN-cached. Weekly
site-perf owns landing budgets. The `/` hero is a two-column layout: headline
plus signup CTAs (anonymous sessions) beside a first-party YouTube light player
with a horizontal video chooser; the lantern/agent orbit sits below that row.
The factory “Trigger it” cards (Flake Hunter, Sentry Issues, Agent inbox,
Purchase thanks) are quiet same-origin links to `/docs/flake-hunter`,
`/docs/sentry-issues`, `/docs/agent-inbox`, and `/docs/purchase-thanks` (pointer
and focus ring only; no extra labels or hover chrome). Signed-in visitors still
see the player and chooser. Chooser membership and order come from the unlisted
playlist `PLBPBUA8boGLA`. Client navigations load
`GET /landing-hero-videos.json`. The lite player embeds the selected chooser
video only, without a playlist id, so YouTube chrome uses that video's title.
Chooser ids are on the YouTube allowlist for `/youtube-thumb` without a playlist
round-trip on plain documents. `/?youtubeId=<id>` opens the site-wide
allowlisted YouTube overlay on those routes; unknown or disallowed ids do not
open the player.
