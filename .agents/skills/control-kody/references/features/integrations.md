# Integrations and OAuth connect

Saved OAuth connections and the hosted connect start.

## How to get there

`/account/integrations` → `/account/integrations/:integrationName`. OAuth apps:
`/account/integrations/apps/:appSlug`. One-click grant:
`/account/integrations/approve`. Start connect: `/connect/oauth`.

## Drive it

```bash
node tools/control-kody.ts request GET /account/integrations.json
```

## APIs

- `GET|POST /account/integrations.json`
- `/connect/oauth` (browser; needs a real provider client)

## Gotchas

- Cloud Agents cannot complete a third-party OAuth dance without credentials in
  the environment. HTTP list/empty-state is the usual proof.
- `/docs/connect` is the public how-to, not the account page.
- OAuth access/refresh tokens and app client secrets live as AES-GCM ciphertext
  on `user_integrations` / `user_oauth_apps`, not as user secret-store rows.
- After a successful `/connect/oauth`, the success page shows a **What's next?**
  prompt the user can copy into chat. Agents `communitySearch` (prefer
  `trusted`) or create a helpers package.
- Account Integrations **Connect with Kody**, the `/connect/oauth` chooser,
  onboarding Step 2 featured buttons, and `integrationPlatformAppList` show only
  enabled + published platform apps. Draft apps stay hidden and keep serving
  existing connections. Never disable an app to hide it — move it to draft.
  Admins flip `enabled` and `visibility` separately on
  `/admin/platform-integrations`.
