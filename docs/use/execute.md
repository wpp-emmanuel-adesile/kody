# Execute and workflows

**execute** runs one ephemeral **ES module** inside Kody's runtime. That module
uses normal **imports** and **exports** and must **default export** the entry
function Kody should invoke.

## Shape of the code

Author code as one module string. Export a default function. On **execute**,
name that argument **`params`** so it mirrors `execute({ code, params })`:

```ts
export default async function main(params) {
	// Use params directly, or pass them to shared helpers.
}
```

Import runtime APIs from **`kody:runtime`** when you need Kody helpers. These
helpers are runtime exports:

- use **`import { kody } from 'kody:runtime'`** to call builtin capabilities
  discovered by **search** as **`await kody.capabilityId(params)`**
- use
  **`import { createAuthenticatedFetch, oauthClientCredentials } from 'kody:runtime'`**
  for OAuth helpers
- use **`import { secretHeaders } from 'kody:runtime'`** when an approved
  `fetch` request needs host-derived auth headers from saved secrets, such as
  Basic Auth from a saved client id and client secret
- use **`import { packageStorage } from 'kody:runtime'`** inside saved-package
  code for the package's own bucket — always, in every package surface; see
  [Package storage](./packages.md#package-storage)
- use **`import { workflows } from 'kody:runtime'`** to queue Cloudflare
  Workflows from execute calls, package jobs, package subscriptions, package
  apps, and package exports. Prefer workflows for durable batch sweeps,
  migrations, polling loops, retryable steps, deferred one-shot work, or work
  that may run longer than execute's timeout. See [Workflows](./workflows.md)
- use **`import { packageContext } from 'kody:runtime'`** inside saved package
  code when you need package metadata; it is **`null`** for ad hoc execute calls
- when a package name is data, use `import(specifier)` for a caller-owned or
  forked module. Exactly-once work uses [workflows](./workflows.md). When the
  target package's name is known when the code is written, use a static
  `kody:@...` import (see below)
- use **`import thing from 'kody:@scope/my-package/export-name'`** or
  **`import { helper } from 'kody:@scope/my-package/export-name'`** to reuse a
  saved package export by npm-scoped package name. This is **the default for
  package reuse** whenever the target package's name is known when the code is
  written: static imports are publish-verified (repo checks prove the export
  exists), dependency-graph-visible (`kody.dependencies`, dependents tracking),
  and have zero per-call platform cost. Ad hoc execute bundles per call, so
  static imports from execute always see the current published version; snapshot
  staleness only affects package-to-package static dependencies, which keep the
  bundled snapshot until the dependent republishes.

`kody:runtime` is always supplied by the Kody host at execution time. Published
package artifacts do not bundle the host runtime; execution always hydrates the
deployed `kody:runtime` module.

Prefer a static `kody:@...` import when the target package's name is known when
the code is written. Use `import(specifier)` when the name is data.

**execute** also accepts optional **`params`**. Kody passes that JSON object to
the module's **default export** as the first function argument. Shared helpers
should receive that object through normal function arguments.

When the `execute-invoke` experiment is on for the caller (operators enable that
flag for the `experiments_opt_in` audience at `/account/experiments`),
**execute** also accepts **`invoke`**: a package export specifier such as
`kody:@scope/package/export` or `@scope/package#export`. `invoke` is mutually
exclusive with `code`. Kody writes the same canonical thin passthrough a careful
agent would write (`import action from "kody:@scope/package/export"` plus a
default export that calls it with `params`) and then runs the ordinary execute
path. The Dynamic Worker identity matches that hand-written module. Arbitrary
URLs are rejected. Vary args via **`params`**.

Ad hoc worker identity follows the acting user plus that **`code`** module
graph. Put varying capability args in **`params`**, not string literals inside
`code`, so the same graph is reused for the UTC day.

Bad (new isolate per distinct literal):

```ts
import { kody } from 'kody:runtime'
export default async function main() {
	return await kody.emailSend({
		subject: 'Hello from Kody',
		text: 'Notify-self mail from an execute module.',
	})
}
```

Good (same graph reused; vary via params):

```ts
import { kody } from 'kody:runtime'
export default async function main(params) {
	return await kody.emailSend(params)
}
// execute({ code, params: { subject: 'Hello from Kody', text: 'Notify-self mail from an execute module.' } })
```

Top-level `await` is acceptable when needed.

### Server-Timing phases

Execute responses include Server-Timing-style phase entries under
**`timing.serverTiming`** (public tool) or top-level **`serverTiming`**
(`meta.execute`): each entry is `{ name, durationMs }`.

- `bundle` — module-graph preparation and bundling. Ad-hoc execute begins the
  run record before this phase and caps it at ~90s so a hung dual heavy-export
  graph finishes as a recorded error instead of a silent MCP client abort.
- `hydrate` — refreshing nested runtime modules, including compatibility
  placeholders retained in already-published bundle snapshots.
- `provider-assembly` — capability registry, runtime helper, and provider wiring
  ahead of sandbox startup.
- `sandbox` — the dynamic worker evaluation of the module itself.
- `run` — the enclosing span for the three phases above (plus run-record and
  usage bookkeeping). Phase durations are measured with `Date.now()`, which the
  Workers runtime only advances across I/O boundaries — synchronous CPU inside
  one phase can be attributed to the next timer read. Treat phases as
  attribution for slow spans, not precise CPU accounting.

## npm packages on Workers

**execute** and saved packages may import npm packages directly when they are
compatible with the Cloudflare Workers runtime. Prefer existing packages over
rewriting helpers; useful starting points include `p-retry`, `mailparser`,
`remark` / `mdast-util-to-markdown`, and `googleapis`.

For ad hoc execute, Kody scans literal bare import specifiers, synthesizes an
ephemeral dependency manifest, and resolves each package at its current registry
version during bundling. Relative and absolute imports and `kody:`,
`cloudflare:`, and `node:` specifiers are not npm dependencies. Registry
resolution failures and packages that cannot bundle for the Workers runtime are
reported as bundle errors. Saved packages continue to declare dependency
versions in their checked-in `package.json`. Ad hoc execute skips publish
checks, so a large import can succeed here and still fail package bundle
validation; see
[Offload work that does not fit a Worker isolate](../guides/heavy-work-offload.md).

For runtime details, see Cloudflare's
[Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/).

## Chaining

Prefer **one execute** when the plan is clear: import what you need, call
several capabilities or package exports, branch on results, and return the final
structured result. Split into multiple **execute** calls only when you need new
user input, confirmation, or a result that changes the plan.

Plain **execute** has a hard timeout (~90s by default). Sandbox outbound `fetch`
is capped at 60s (30s under that budget) unless the caller passes a tighter
`AbortSignal`. For multi-step or long-running work (>~60s, batch sweeps,
migrations, polling loops), use one **execute** call to submit
`workflows.create({ code, params })`, then inspect progress with
`workflowRunList` instead of chaining many MCP tool calls. Sandbox timeout
errors state the enforced budget (for example
`Execution timed out after 90s: …`) and carry a structured next step pointing at
workflows.

### Recovering from MCP client timeouts

A timeout means the MCP client stopped waiting. Kody aborts that inbound
request's sandbox, including a keyed package invocation nested under it, and
finishes the run as `errorName=client_disconnected` with a log line. The attempt
does not stay `running` until platform reconciliation. Already-started remote
side effects may still complete. Do not blindly retry a timed-out side-effecting
call. Check **Recent runs** or `runList` before starting another sandbox.

Pass an optional **`idempotencyKey`** (string, max 256 characters) when the call
must be recoverable:

- Kody persists that execute run **eagerly** (a `running` row at start, terminal
  row at finish) and stores a **bounded result snapshot** on the run record.
- The tool response includes **`runId`** whenever a record exists — poll
  **`runGet`** with it if the client timed out.
- Retrying with the **same** `idempotencyKey` after completion returns the
  retained result with **`replayed: true`** and the same **`runId`** (no second
  sandbox).
- Retrying while the first attempt is still running returns
  **`inProgress: true`** with the **`runId`** (no duplicate start).
- A caller disconnect finishes the run as **`errorName=client_disconnected`**.
  Retrying the same key replays that error. Use a new idempotency key to run the
  work again.
- If a keyed run is stranded as `running` (for example the Worker isolate reset
  before the terminal write), Kody reconciles it to an error with
  **`errorName=platform_interrupted`** after a few minutes (platform weather;
  outcome unknown — not a user-authored package failure). Keyed package
  invocations write `package invocation started: …` onto the running row before
  sandbox work, so that reconciled row is not an empty log. Polling **`runGet`**
  or retrying the same key then returns that terminal outcome instead of
  `inProgress` forever.

Omit the key for ordinary short calls. Those runs are still listed in Activity
when they finish. Pass a key when a retry must return the retained result
instead of running again.

To read field shapes while coding, use **search** with
**`entity: "capability:{name}"`** for builtin capability type definitions, or
inspect the relevant saved package with **`entity: "package:{package-name}"`**.
Capability detail includes a complete **execute** module snippet; the runtime
call itself is always through the imported `kody` object.

## Saved packages

Saved packages, package jobs, and one-off **execute** code share the same
module-oriented runtime model:

- saved packages persist repo-backed source rooted at `package.json`
- package identity is the scoped `package.json.name` (`@scope/leaf`) or the UUID
  `package_id` when the name is not known; the leaf is the URL slug
- package exports are defined by standard `package.json.exports`
- package-specific metadata lives under `package.json#kody`
- package jobs are schedules declared under `package.json#kody.jobs`
- package apps are optional UI surfaces declared under `package.json#kody.app`
- deferred one-shot work uses **`workflows.create({ runAt, ... })`** from
  `execute` or package runtime — see [Workflows](./workflows.md)
- **`kody.jobUpdate(...)`** updates metadata on an existing job (schedule,
  timezone, enabled, kill switch, preserved, `expires_at`). Package job name and
  source stay in the package repo.
- Optional **`expires_at`** on `jobUpdate` stops the platform from scheduling
  the job after that UTC time. When expiry is reached, Kody auto-disables the
  job (`enabled=false`) so it shows as disabled in `jobList` / `jobGet` (with
  `expired: true`) and can age out via normal retention. This is separate from
  **`preserved`**, which only skips auto-deletion.
- **`kody.jobGet({ id, includeCode: true })`** returns the scheduled job
  inspection details plus the stored entrypoint path and source code
- Package-owned jobs are removed by editing the package and publishing, not by
  `jobDelete`.
- **`kody.jobRunNow(...)`** runs an existing scheduled job immediately and
  returns both the updated job state and the execution result for debugging.
  Expired jobs are rejected.

Static saved-package imports from ad hoc **execute** run under the ad hoc
execute runtime. That means imported package modules can share exported helpers,
but `packageContext` remains **`null`** because the imported module has not been
entered as its own package runtime. Imported modules keep stamped
`packageStorage()` and stamp-aligned secret authority: A's export may use
secrets locked to A (or A's `kody.secretMounts`) without granting those secrets
to the execute entry. The execute entry cannot select A's id on
`kody.packageSecretGet` / `Has`; only A's stamped `packageSecrets` binding
carries that authority. Unstamped execute entry code can still use **your** user
secrets through `{{secret:...}}` placeholders; it cannot use A's mounts.
`packageContext` stays `null` on ad hoc execute.

When you need to edit saved source, prefer the repo-backed workflow in
[Repo-backed editing sessions](./repo-sessions.md). Open by package identity
instead of internal source ids whenever possible.

For common edit-and-check workflows, use the file-level repo session API
documented in [Repo-backed editing sessions](./repo-sessions.md): open a session
with `repoOpenSession`, edit with `repoEditFiles` or `repoApplyPatch`, inspect
with `repoDiff`, commit with `repoCommit`, validate with `repoRunChecks`, and
publish with `repoPublishSession`. There is no git-command channel inside
sessions; use `packageGetGitRemote` for full git.

## Agent turns

Generic tool-using agent turns are package-owned behavior rather than a built-in
runtime primitive. Search for an agent-turn package, then import that package
from execute or another saved package.

## Storage

Ad hoc execute has no scratch SQLite helper. Persist durable state from a saved
package with **`packageStorage()`**. Another package's data goes through a
static import of that package's export so its stamp does the reading and
writing. See [Package storage](./packages.md#package-storage).

`packageStorage()` exposes `get` / `set` / `list` / `sql` / `delete` / `clear` /
`id`. `sql(...)` returns a result object, not the row array directly:

```ts
import { packageStorage } from 'kody:runtime'

const result = await packageStorage().sql('select value from counters')

return {
	columns: result.columns,
	rows: result.rows,
	rowCount: result.rowCount,
	rowsRead: result.rowsRead,
	rowsWritten: result.rowsWritten,
	truncated: result.truncated,
}
```

Read query rows from **`result.rows`**. The other fields are useful for
inspection and debugging, especially when validating whether a query read or
wrote storage. `sql(...)` returns at most 1000 rows and sets `truncated: true`
when more matched — page with `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` (or a keyset) for larger results.
Mutating statements that yield rows (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE … RETURNING`)
still finish the write when truncated; only the returned row list is capped.

For dedicated inspection, use:

- **`storageExport`** — export one storage bucket as JSON (`page_size` max 1000)
- **`storageQuery`** — run SQL against one storage bucket (read-only by default,
  opt into writes explicitly). Returns at most 1000 rows and sets
  `truncated: true` when more matched — same cap as `sql(...)`.

Both are scoped to the caller. Code running as a saved package (invocations,
jobs, package apps, retrievers) may name only buckets that package owns — its
own bucket, its app facet buckets, and its package job buckets. Another
package's bucket is reachable only through `packageStorage()`, which is gated by
bundler-recorded provenance grants.

## Long-term memory

Kody can surface a small number of relevant long-term memories when you pass a
short **`memoryContext`** on normal MCP tool calls. `search` also retrieves from
the query string. Surfaced memories appear in the tool text as subject and
summary only (id in structured content). Later retrievals can repeat that
compact block. Full contract (including `dedupe_key` collapse and the verify
workflow): [Memory and conversation context](./memory.md).

Handled **execute** responses also include top-level **`timing`** metadata with
`startedAt`, `endedAt`, and `durationMs` alongside `conversationId`. Use it for
basic latency instrumentation around tool runs.

When a call is denied by a plan limit or a daily quota, the existing error
message and `isError: true` stay the same. Structured content also includes a
focused **`entitlement`** object with known fields only (resource, current plan,
limit, current usage, upgrade hint). Daily quota denials add compact `used` and
`remaining`. Ordinary successful execute results omit `entitlement`.

Dynamic Worker identity for an execute run follows the acting user and that
module graph. The same user and graph reuse one isolate for the UTC day when
only `params` or `packageContext` change. The cost model is documented once in
[Platform efficiency](../guides/platform-efficiency.md).

For memory mutations, the workflow is explicit and strict:

- **Always run `metaMemoryVerify` before writing or deleting memory**
- then decide whether to call **`metaMemoryUpsert`**, **`metaMemoryDelete`**,
  both, or neither
- **`metaMemoryUpsert`** creates a new memory when **`memory_id`** is omitted
  and updates an existing memory when **`memory_id`** is provided

Kody retrieves related memories, but the **consuming agent** is responsible for
deciding what action to take.

## MCP server instructions

Users can read or replace their own MCP server instruction overlay with
**`metaGetMcpServerInstructions`** and **`metaSetMcpServerInstructions`**.

This overlay is appended after Kody's built-in server instructions for that
user. Prefer **memories** for durable facts and preferences; use the overlay
only for rare always-on session policy — not for maintaining a package
inventory. Discover packages and other capabilities with **`search`**. Pass an
empty string to clear the overlay. Changes apply to new MCP sessions, so
reconnect the MCP client if the host caches server instructions.

Some MCP clients keep only the first 2048 characters of server instructions.
**`metaGetMcpServerInstructions`** and **`metaSetMcpServerInstructions`** report
`assembled_chars` and a `warning` when the assembled text meets that cut, so the
overlay may never reach the model.

## Network and OAuth helpers

The sandbox exposes global **`fetch`** plus secret placeholders in approved
contexts. OAuth and secret-header helpers are imported from **`kody:runtime`**:

**`import { createAuthenticatedFetch, oauthClientCredentials, secretHeaders } from 'kody:runtime'`**

`createAuthenticatedFetch(providerName)` is async. Await it before calling the
returned fetch wrapper:

```ts
const googleFetch = await createAuthenticatedFetch('google-business')
const response = await googleFetch('/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList')
```

Integration names should usually follow `<provider>-<purpose>` when multiple
accounts may exist, such as `google`, `google-business`, or
`google-youtube-brand`. Call **`integrationList`** up front when a provider may
have multiple accounts connected.

OAuth integrations may include `authorization` metadata with the saved
`authorizeUrl`, requested `scopes`, any non-default `scopeSeparator`, and
provider-specific `extraAuthorizeParams`. Use that metadata when a refresh token
is stale and the user needs to reconnect; open
`/connect/oauth?provider=<integration-name>` instead of guessing the scope set.

For OAuth 2 `client_credentials` token exchanges that require
`Authorization: Basic base64(client_id:client_secret)`, save the client id and
client secret separately. Do **not** ask the user to precompute or save the
derived Basic header. Use `secretHeaders.basic(...)` directly in a fetch header,
or use `oauthClientCredentials(...)` for the token request. These examples use a
placeholder API host and generic client credential secret names:

```ts
import { oauthClientCredentials } from 'kody:runtime'

export default async function main() {
	const token = await oauthClientCredentials({
		tokenUrl: 'https://api.example.com/oauth/token',
		clientIdSecret: 'exampleClientId',
		clientSecretSecret: 'exampleClientSecret',
		scope: 'user',
	})

	return { tokenType: token.token_type, hasAccessToken: !!token.access_token }
}
```

For the lower-level token request built directly with `secretHeaders.basic`, see
the worked example in [Secrets and host approval](./secrets-and-values.md).

Kody resolves both saved secrets server-side, requires the token endpoint host
to be approved for both secrets, and only sends the derived Basic header in the
outbound request.

See [Secrets and host approval](./secrets-and-values.md) for placeholders, host
approval, **`kody.secretList`** / **`secretSet`**, and the rules for mentioning
placeholder syntax without resolving it (the inert `{{secret:<name>}}` form and
the `x-kody-secret-resolution: off` header). Treat placeholder syntax as
operational wiring, not prose — never place a resolvable **`{{secret:...}}`**
token into content shown to users or sent to third parties.

## Named state

Durable facts and preferences belong in memories. Package runtime state and
knobs belong in **`packageStorage()`**. Versioned config belongs in a repo. API
keys, PATs, and HMAC secrets belong in the secret store. OAuth access and
refresh tokens, and a user-registered app's client secret, live on the
integration.

## Returning content blocks

By default, **`execute`** returns text output. To return non-text MCP content
blocks such as images, return an object with a **`__mcpContent`** array instead;
see [Raw MCP content blocks](./raw-content-blocks.md).

The same passthrough applies when execute returns a result from a user-added MCP
server that already includes protocol image (or other non-text) content blocks.

**`responseLimit`** caps ordinary JSON/text output (~100 KB by default).
Protocol `__mcpContent` blocks use a separate ~512 KB content cap so valid
images larger than 100 KB are not collapsed into truncated JSON.
