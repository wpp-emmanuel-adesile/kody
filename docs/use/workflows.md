# Workflows

Kody exposes Cloudflare Workflows through `kody:runtime` in every server-side
runtime context: `execute`, package jobs, package subscriptions, package
exports, and package apps.

Use workflows instead of plain `execute` for durable batch sweeps, migrations,
polling loops, retryable steps, or work that may run longer than execute's
timeout (~90s). Workflow-invoked package exports and inline workflow code get a
longer sandbox budget (~4.5 minutes, under the Cloudflare Workflow step timeout)
and run without the package-invocation idempotency ledger, so a step retry
re-executes instead of replaying a cached timeout. Outbound `fetch` in that
sandbox is capped ~30s under the same budget (~4 minutes), so a single slow
upstream can finish without the execute-oriented 60s fetch deadline. The initial
`execute` call should submit one `workflows.create`; inspect that workflow later
with `workflowRunList`, or cancel it with `workflowRunCancel`. Check-heavy admin
steps such as fleet apply, dry-run, and revert take one page per workflow
sandbox; when `nextCursor` is set, create another workflow with that `runId` and
cursor instead of looping in the same run.

```ts
import { workflows } from 'kody:runtime'

export default async function main(params) {
	return await workflows.create({
		code: 'export default async function main(p) { return { ok: true, p } }',
		params: { greeting: params.greeting ?? 'hello' },
	})
}
```

Check status from a later MCP call:

```ts
import { kody } from 'kody:runtime'

export default async function main() {
	return await kody.workflowRunList({ limit: 10 })
}
```

`workflows.create` accepts one durable workflow request with two source shapes:

- `code`: a complete ESM module string with a default export. Kody runs it later
  through the same module loader used by `execute`, including static `kody:@`
  imports and `import(specifier)` when the package name is data.
- `exportName`: a saved-package export to invoke later. In package runtime code,
  Kody resolves `packageId` from `packageContext`. Outside a package runtime,
  pass `packageId` explicitly.

Both shapes accept:

- `workflowName`: optional display name. When omitted, inline workflows fall
  back to `inline-code` and package workflows fall back to the export path. On
  `/account/workflows` and Activity, a displayed `inline-code` name shows the
  idempotency key as a subtitle so those runs stay distinguishable.
- `runAt`: optional ISO date-time string or `Date`; defaults to now
- `idempotencyKey`: optional caller-chosen dedupe key; omitted keys create a
  fresh run
- `params`: optional JSON object passed to the workflow body

Calling `create` again with the same explicit `idempotencyKey` and matching
workflow identity for the same user returns the existing workflow instead of
starting a duplicate. Choose keys that include the logical job identity, for
example `storage-sweep:2026-05-08`. Kody enforces a finite per-user concurrent
workflow limit from the account plan (see
[Plans and pricing](https://kody.codes/pricing)); if the cap is reached,
`workflows.create` returns a clear quota error.

Use `workflowRunList` to inspect recent workflow runs and statuses, and
`workflowRunCancel` to stop a run by id.

## Cancelling workflow runs

`workflowRunCancel({ id })` cancels one workflow run by id. Run ids look like
`dynwf-…` for inline runs and `pkgwf-…` for package runs; get them from
`workflows.create` output or `workflowRunList`. The call terminates the
underlying Cloudflare Workflow instance and marks the run `cancelled` in
`workflowRunList`.

You can only cancel your own runs. Unknown ids or another user's id return a
"not found" error.

Cancelling an already-finished run (`complete`, `errored`, `terminated`, or
`cancelled`) is a safe no-op: the response has `cancelled: false` and
`already_terminal: true` with the run's terminal status. Cancelling is
idempotent. If the run finishes in the moment you cancel it, the cancel reports
the run's actual terminal status instead of pretending it was cancelled. In rare
races a cancelled run can instead surface as `terminated` (the engine's own
terminal status) — treat `cancelled` and `terminated` both as "the run was
stopped".

A cancelled run keeps single-flighting its idempotency key, exactly like a
`complete` or `errored` run — calling `workflows.create` again with the same key
returns the cancelled run instead of starting a new one. To genuinely re-run,
pick a new idempotency key. This prevents a cancelled self-rescheduling chain
from being accidentally revived by a retry that reuses old keys.

Cancelling one run does not un-schedule runs it already created. Each queued run
is an independent workflow instance — use `workflowRunList` to find every queued
run in the chain and cancel each one by id. A run that is mid-execution may
still create its successor before termination lands, so list again after
cancelling to catch stragglers.

```ts
import { kody } from 'kody:runtime'

export default async function main() {
	return await kody.workflowRunCancel({ id: 'dynwf-abc123' })
}
```

## Package export example

```ts
import { workflows } from 'kody:runtime'

export default async function main() {
	return await workflows.create({
		packageId: 'pkg_123',
		exportName: './workflow-run-event',
		runAt: new Date(Date.now() + 60_000).toISOString(),
		idempotencyKey: 'sync-account-123',
		params: { accountId: 'account-123' },
	})
}
```

Saved package jobs and subscriptions call the same `workflows.create` helper.
Workflow entrypoints are not declared under `kody.workflows`; the hub resolves
any package export by name at runtime, so calling
`workflows.create({ exportName: './workflow-run-event' })` from a package
runtime context is enough.
