# Package app fetch

`packageAppFetch` invokes a published package app over MCP — the fetch handler
`kody.app.entry` exports. It is a **platform-marked real-surface** `app_fetch`
run: same package runtime, `packageStorage()`, and secret mounts as production
traffic. **Side effects are real.** `path` is mount-relative (`/notes`); the
handler sees that stripped path, exactly like a browser request after the host
strips the mount.

Use it to verify `kody.app` wiring and JSON/API responses immediately after
publish — without opening the hosted URL in a browser or performing session
handoff.

The platform strips caller-supplied `Kody-Synthetic` from MCP input (same as
public app ingress) and sets `Kody-Synthetic: true` before the handler runs.
Handlers treat synthetic fetches identically to production unless a deliberately
visible irreversible-side-effect guard says otherwise.

Hosted-URL checks remain useful for UI, OAuth redirects, and websocket facets.

## When to use it

- After `packagePublishExternalPush` when the package declares
  `package.json#kody.app`
- When `test_hints.app` is present on the publish response (copy-paste starting
  point)
- To prove a fetch handler returns expected status/body before sharing
  `hosted_app_url` with a user

Prefer a static `kody:@scope/package/export` import from `execute` for export
smoke tests. Prefer [Inbound webhooks](./webhooks.md) ingress for provider POST
deliveries.

## Call shape

Search the `packages` domain, then call `packageAppFetch`:

```json
{
	"package_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

Optional request fields:

| Field           | Default | Meaning                                                         |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `package_scope` | omitted | Owner scope for delegated packages; preserve it from test hints |
| `path`          | `/`     | Path **after** the app mount (what the handler sees)            |
| `method`        | `GET`   | HTTP method                                                     |
| `headers`       | `{}`    | Extra request headers (safe subset)                             |
| `body`          | omitted | Raw request body string for `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH`            |

Example POST with JSON:

```json
{
	"package_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
	"path": "/api/items",
	"method": "POST",
	"headers": { "content-type": "application/json" },
	"body": "{\"name\":\"smoke\"}"
}
```

Look up the package with the scoped `@owner/leaf` name (or `package_id` when the
name is not known). When `test_hints.app` includes `package_scope`, preserve
that exact owner scope so the probe cannot resolve an unrelated same-named
package in the caller's personal scope.

Websocket upgrade requests (`Upgrade: websocket`, `Connection: Upgrade`, or
equivalent) are rejected.

## Response

The capability returns exactly:

| Field       | Meaning                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status`    | HTTP status code                                                       |
| `headers`   | Response headers (safe allowlisted subset)                             |
| `body`      | Response body text, or base64 when the handler returns binary content  |
| `truncated` | `true` when the body was truncated to fit the MCP response size budget |

Failures surface as structured MCP errors with the handler's thrown message or
non-2xx body when applicable. A host-setup 500
(`Package app could not be prepared`) includes `cause` with the platform error
so the failure is not an opaque smoke-test dead end. Check
[Activity](./activity.md) (`app_fetch` surface) for run records; the run record
carries the same `Kody-Synthetic` marker the handler saw. Host-setup failures
happen before the isolate starts, so they do not appear as `app_fetch` run
errors.

## Semantics

- Resolves the signed-in user's saved package at its current published commit.
- Strips credential headers (`Cookie`, `Authorization`, and internal `X-Kody-*`
  headers) before the handler runs — same rule as public package-app ingress.
- Populates `packageContext` (`hostedUrl`, `appBasePath`) from the serving
  username and package name leaf.
- Does **not** count toward package activation milestones.

## Platform assets under `/_assets/`

`packageAppFetch` goes through the same serve path as the browser, so on a host
that serves platform client assets, `path: "/_assets/__version.json"` returns
the current `clientModuleUrl` and `path: "/_assets/<file>"` returns files from
`kody.app.assets` — the fetch handler is never invoked for those paths. A 404 on
`/_assets/__version.json` means the host does not serve client assets yet, not
that the handler is broken; see
[Troubleshooting](../guides/package-apps.md#troubleshooting).
