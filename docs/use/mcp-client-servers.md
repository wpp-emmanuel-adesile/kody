# Connect remote MCP servers to Kody

Kody can act as an **MCP client**: you add a remote MCP server, and its tools
become callable as `kody.mcp["server-name"].tool_name(...)`. That is connection
wiring, not package runtime. See
[Packages, integrations, and MCP servers](../guides/packages-integrations-mcp.md)
when those three look interchangeable.

This is the inverse of [connecting your agent to Kody](./connect-your-agent.md)
(where Kody is the MCP _server_).

## Add a server

1. Open [`/account/mcp-servers`](https://kody.codes/account/mcp-servers), or ask
   your agent to use `mcpServerAdd` with a short kebab-case `name` and the
   server `url` (https required). PostHog's documented endpoint is
   `https://mcp.posthog.com/mcp` — the site root redirects to docs and will not
   finish tool discovery. Kody rewrites that exact origin to `/mcp`.
2. If the server authenticates with a static bearer token (or other))
   Authorization scheme), paste it in the optional Bearer token field — or pass
   `bearerToken` to `mcpServerAdd`. Bare tokens are sent as
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; scheme-prefixed values and full
   `Authorization: …` header pastes are normalized. The credential is stored
   only in your private MCP client hub and is never returned later.
3. If the server needs OAuth, Kody returns an authorization link. Open it, sign
   in at the provider, and approve access.
4. Confirm with `mcpServerList` (or refresh the account page). The connected
   server shows up in `search` as an **mcp-server** hit (name and server
   instructions). List its tools with `search({ entity: "mcp-server:<name>" })`
   or `search({ domain: "mcp:<name>" })`. If the identity provider approved
   access but tools never appear, Status on `/account/mcp-servers/:serverId`
   shows the last sanitized settle error (phase, HTTP status, URLs, and an
   attempt id). The same durable error is written when add, reconnect, or
   refresh times out still discovering tools after Kody has also retried the
   older MCP handshake. Reconnect from that page.

If a server is authenticating, failed, or disconnected, [Waiting](./waiting.md)
lists it and links to `/account/mcp-servers/:id`. `waitingSummary` returns the
same items. When a server that was already connected later asks for
authorization again, Status and `mcpServerList.error` include the sanitized
token-refresh reason (for example a rejected or already-used refresh token).
`mcpServerList` also reports `hasRefreshToken` so agents can tell whether Kody
still has a refresh token without reading the secret. Kody keeps a stored
refresh token when the server's token response omits a new one, including across
Durable Object restore when the OAuth client id is not in SQL yet. If the
authorization server advertised refresh support but the token response had no
refresh token, Status and `mcpServerList.error` stay visible while the server is
still Connected so the access-token expiry is not a surprise. One successful
Authorize + callback is enough: a replay of the callback URL settles with the
tokens from the first exchange instead of asking you to approve again.
`mcpServerReconnect` tries that refresh before minting a new authorization link.
Packages that subscribe to `mcp.server.disconnected` (for example a Discord
notifier on `package.json#kody.subscriptions`) receive the event when a
previously connected server parks needing re-auth — including the durable
“Authorization required / no refresh token” card — even if waiting or search
notices the park first.

## Lock a server to a package

By default every enabled server is callable from execute and every package. Set
**Usage** on `/account/mcp-servers/:serverId` to **Specific packages only**, or
ask an agent to call `mcpServerLock` with the server and a saved `package_id`.

After that lock:

- Ad hoc execute cannot call `kody.mcp["server-name"]`.
- Packages that are not on the grant list cannot call it either.
- Approved packages still can, including jobs and package apps.
- `mcpServerList` still shows the server to the owner.

Agents can lock (grant). Unlocking or removing a grant is website-only on that
server's account page. See
[Lock an MCP server to a package](../guides/locked-mcp-server.md).

## OAuth allowlists (common failure)

When Kody connects, it identifies itself as an OAuth client using:

- **Client origin:** the deployment's canonical app origin (for hosted Kody,
  `https://kody.codes`)
- **Redirect URI:** `{origin}/account/mcp-servers/oauth/callback`
- **Client ID Metadata Document (HTTPS only):**
  `{origin}/oauth/client-metadata.json`

On HTTPS deployments, Kody presents that CIMD URL as `client_id` when the remote
authorization server advertises `client_id_metadata_document_supported`.
Otherwise it falls back to Dynamic Client Registration. Local `http` origins
skip CIMD and use DCR only.

Many authorization servers (including FusionAuth "authorized origins" / redirect
URI settings, and other providers with similar allowlists) reject the authorize
step unless those values are permitted.

If authorization fails with a message like `Invalid origin uri https://…` or an
invalid redirect URI error:

1. In the remote MCP server's identity provider, allow Kody's client origin and
   register the exact redirect URI shown on `/account/mcp-servers` (also
   returned as `oauthClientOrigin` / `oauthCallbackUrl` from `mcpServerAdd` and
   `mcpServerList`).
2. Remove and re-add the server in Kody (or reconnect) so client registration
   picks up the allowlisted values.
3. Authorize again.

Kody itself does not maintain a per-provider allowlist for this flow — the
remote authorization server does.

Servers that do not use OAuth connect immediately and do not need these steps.
Bearer-token servers also skip OAuth when the static Authorization header is
enough for the remote server.

## Home MCP servers

Household LAN tools (notes, lights, TVs, thermostats, local CLIs) belong on a
process you run at home. Publish that process with Cloudflare Tunnel and Access,
then add the HTTPS `/mcp` URL here as `home` (or another short name). The
[home MCP guide](../guides/local-mcp-tunnels.md) and
[home-mcp-starter](https://github.com/kody-bot/home-mcp-starter) cover CIMD
OAuth, Docker, and the Access path split. After authorize, call
`kody.mcp["home"].tool_name(...)`.
