# Inbound webhooks

Kody inbound webhooks are **package-centered**: you declare them in
`package.json#kody.webhooks`, mint an opaque handle with `webhookUrlMint`, then
register the credential with `webhookUrlApply` (generic HTTPS, including the
GitHub Hooks API) or copy the URL yourself from the package's
[settings page](#manage-webhook-urls-in-package-settings). MCP and execute never
return the credential URL or `url_secret`. Each delivery invokes the bound
package export.

This is the HTTP sibling of [email primitives](./email-primitives.md). Webhooks
are the external HTTP knock: vendor providers (Sentry, GitHub, Stripe) and
first-party trusted clients (gateway proxies, CLIs) both POST to a minted URL.
[Package invocation bearer tokens](../contributing/package-invocation-api.md)
are an unadvertised drain; new callers use webhooks.

There is no `*` / multi-export URL. One declared webhook name binds one export.

Treat every minted URL as a **credential**. Mint and rotate return an opaque
`handle` (and `url_host`), never the URL or `url_secret`. Register the URL with
`webhookUrlApply` so the credential stays inside Kody, or open the package's
[settings page](#manage-webhook-urls-in-package-settings) and copy it yourself
for providers without an apply adapter. MCP and execute never return the URL;
the owner does that from package settings.

## Declare a webhook in the package manifest

```json
{
	"name": "@you/sentry-bridge",
	"exports": {
		"./handle-sentry-webhook": "./src/handle-sentry-webhook.ts"
	},
	"kody": {
		"id": "sentry-bridge",
		"description": "Forward Sentry webhooks into automations",
		"webhooks": [
			{
				"name": "sentry",
				"export": "./handle-sentry-webhook",
				"responseMode": "ack",
				"verification": {
					"type": "hmac-sha256",
					"header": "sentry-hook-signature",
					"secretName": "sentryWebhookSecret",
					"encoding": "hex"
				}
			}
		]
	}
}
```

Rules:

- `name` is a slug unique within the package.
- `export` must reference a declared `package.json#exports` entry (validated at
  save/publish). One webhook name ↔ one export. There is no wildcard export.
- `responseMode` is `ack` (default) or `sync`.
- `inputMode` is `request` (default) or `params`. Vendor handlers stay on
  `request`. First-party trusted clients that send invoke-shaped JSON use
  `params` (see [Trusted clients](#trusted-clients)).
- `rateLimitPerMinute` is optional. Default **60**. Maximum **600** (gateway
  fan-in). A leaked URL is still bounded; there is no unlimited setting.
- `verification.secretName` is **optional**. Omit it for GitHub-style hooks
  where Kody mints package-owned HMAC onto the webhook URL record at
  `webhookUrlMint` (not listed in account secrets, no host Allow). Set it only
  for **provider-issued** signing secrets that must live in the secret store
  (for example Sentry). Never put an inline secret value in the manifest.
- `verification.signedPayload` is `'body'` (default) or `'timestamp.body'`. Use
  `'timestamp.body'` when the provider HMAC covers
  `` `${timestamp}.${rawBody}` ``.
- `challenge` is optional. When set, the platform answers the provider's
  ownership quiz on the **same minted URL** (GET CRC / hub challenge, or Slack
  `url_verification` POST) without invoking your export. See
  [Subscription challenges](#subscription-challenges).
- `replay` is optional. Without it, body-only HMAC is **replayable**: anyone who
  observes one legitimate signed delivery can POST it again. Opt in per webhook
  with a timestamp window and/or a unique delivery id. Trusted clients send
  `Idempotency-Key` instead of `replay.deliveryIdHeader`.

Declaring a webhook does **not** open ingress by itself.

## Mint a handle

Use the MCP `webhooks` domain:

1. Save/publish the package with `kody.webhooks`.
2. For provider-issued HMAC only, store that secret with `secretSet` under
   `verification.secretName` (for example `sentryWebhookSecret`). GitHub-style
   hooks that use `{{webhookSecret}}` on apply should **omit**
   `verification.secretName` — Kody mints package-owned signing material when
   you mint the URL.
3. Call `webhookUrlMint` with the scoped package name (or `package_id` when the
   name is not known) and `webhookName`.
4. Call `webhookUrlApply` with the returned `handle` and a `type: "http"`
   destination. Kody POSTs/PUTs the minted URL into any HTTPS registration
   endpoint via `{{webhookUrl}}` substitution (for example GitHub's
   `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/hooks`). The owner can copy the URL from the
   package's [settings page](#manage-webhook-urls-in-package-settings)
   (`/@<username>/<packageKodyId>/settings#webhooks`) when that is simpler.

Other capabilities: `webhookList` (declarations — including `verification`,
`replay`, and `challenge` — joined with minted handle / enabled state),
`webhookUrlRotate`, `webhookEnable`, `webhookDisable`, `webhookDeliveryList`
(metadata only; bodies are never stored), and `webhookSyntheticDispatch`
(interactive-MCP smoke test for a minted webhook — see
[Synthetic smoke test](#synthetic-smoke-test)). The same delivery history also
appears under [Activity](./activity.md) (`/account/activity` and the `runs`
capabilities). List, mint, rotate, apply, and synthetic dispatch never return
the credential URL.

## Manage webhook URLs in package settings

Webhooks belong to the package that declares them, so the signed-in owner
manages their URLs on that package's settings page:
`/@<username>/<packageKodyId>/settings`, **Webhooks** section (for example
`/@kentcdodds/raycast/settings#webhooks`). The section lists every webhook the
package declares, joined with its minted state, one card per webhook:

- **Mint URL** issues the first credential for a declared webhook and shows the
  URL once so you can paste it into the provider.
- **Reveal URL** shows a minted URL again, with a copy button. Each reveal is
  written to the account audit log.
- **Rotate URL** replaces the secret. The previous URL stays active for **24
  hours**, or until the first accepted delivery arrives on the new URL. Rerun
  `webhookUrlApply` (same handle) or paste the new URL into the provider. The
  card shows “Previous URL active until …” during that overlap.
- **Disable** / **Enable** toggle ingress without deleting the mint. Disabled
  webhooks answer 404.

The URL is the human path. Agents get the handle and `url_host` through MCP and
either apply the handle (`type: "http"`) or ask the owner to copy the URL from
package settings. Mints that predate encrypted secret storage cannot be shown;
the card offers Rotate for those.

`/account/webhooks` (account rail → Webhooks) is a read-only index of every
webhook across your packages. Each row links to the owning package's Webhooks
section; nothing is minted or revealed from the index.

### Apply a handle to a destination

`webhookUrlApply` resolves the handle inside Kody and registers the URL through
an outbound HTTPS request (`type: "http"`). The model never sees the secret:
Kody injects the minted URL server-side via `{{webhookUrl}}` and returns only
`{ ok, url_host, http_status, remote_id, error }`. Remote bodies that echo the
hook URL are redacted.

Owner rationale: the signed-in owner can already reveal and paste the URL from
package settings. Opaque apply exists so agents can register that same
credential without pulling plaintext into model context — including at
caller-chosen HTTPS endpoints. Settings reveal/paste is owner consent. Silent
model-chosen apply to an arbitrary URL is not: prompt injection could POST the
long-lived credential to an attacker endpoint. Generic `http` therefore requires
an interactive hard confirm that surfaces the exact destination before the
outbound request runs.

Generic HTTPS (`type: "http"`) — Kody sends the request and substitutes
`{{webhookUrl}}` (and optional `{{webhookSecret}}`) into `url`, header values,
and/or `body` (form bodies are decoded/re-encoded). `{{webhookUrl}}` is
required. `{{webhookSecret}}` injects **package-owned HMAC signing material**
stored on the minted webhook URL record (not a user secrets-list entry, and not
host-gated). When a package declares `verification.secretName`, reminting (or
rotating) the URL copies that value onto the endpoint when the named secret
exists — apply never does a live `secretName` lookup for `{{webhookSecret}}` (so
changing the name after destination Allow cannot swap credentials). Destination
`secretName` / `integration` Bearer auth requires host approval / integration
allowlists. Destination URLs must be `https://`. Redirects are not followed.
Auth is optional via `secretName` or `integration` (Bearer), or a
caller-supplied `Authorization` header — not both. Destination `secretName` /
`integration` authorize the outbound request; they are not the webhook HMAC
signing secret.

That path is **interactive MCP only** and reuses the same **account owner
approval flow** as secret host approval (`/connect/secrets`), secret package
grants, and locked-package publish approval: the capability returns an
`approval_url` to `/connect/webhook-apply` with the exact method, URL,
`{{webhookUrl}}` / `{{webhookSecret}}` injection sites, headers, body template,
and auth mode. The signed-in owner Allows on the website (writing a durable
destination grant); the agent then retries and the outbound request runs.
Package runtimes cannot use `http` apply. Agents never grant access and never
see the webhook credential.

```ts
await kody.webhooks.webhookUrlApply({
	handle,
	destination: {
		type: 'http',
		url: 'https://hooks.example/register',
		method: 'POST',
		headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
		body: '{"webhookUrl":"{{webhookUrl}}"}',
		secretName: 'hooksRegistrationToken',
	},
})
// If approval is required, send the owner approval_url (/connect/webhook-apply),
// wait for Allow, then retry the same call.
```

GitHub repository hooks use the same `http` path against the Hooks API
(`POST https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/hooks`). Put `{{webhookUrl}}`
in `config.url`, include `User-Agent: kody` (GitHub requires a User-Agent), send
the GitHub Accept / API-Version headers, and authorize with
`integration: 'github'` (or a host-approved token via `secretName`). Declare
HMAC `verification` **without** `secretName` so mint stores package-owned
signing material, and put `{{webhookSecret}}` in `config.secret`:

```ts
await kody.webhooks.webhookUrlApply({
	handle,
	destination: {
		type: 'http',
		url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/acme/api/hooks',
		method: 'POST',
		headers: {
			Accept: 'application/vnd.github+json',
			'Content-Type': 'application/json',
			'User-Agent': 'kody',
			'X-GitHub-Api-Version': '2022-11-28',
		},
		body: JSON.stringify({
			name: 'web',
			active: true,
			events: ['push', 'pull_request'],
			config: {
				url: '{{webhookUrl}}',
				content_type: 'json',
				insecure_ssl: '0',
				secret: '{{webhookSecret}}',
			},
		}),
		integration: 'github',
	},
})
```

`{{webhookSecret}}` injects package-owned HMAC from the webhook URL record (or a
value copied from `verification.secretName` at mint/rotate). If the placeholder
is present but verification is undeclared, or package-owned HMAC is missing,
apply fails with a clear error. Omit `{{webhookSecret}}` when the webhook has no
HMAC verification. GitHub-style hooks that declare `verification.secretName` can
drop that secrets-list entry after reminting (with the named secret present so
mint can copy it) or after reminting without `secretName`.

Prefer `http` for Workers and any provider API that accepts a callback URL
field. Providers that need an ownership quiz (X Activity CRC, WebSub / YouTube,
Meta, Slack URL verification) use a declared
[`challenge`](#subscription-challenges) on the webhook — you do not need a shim
Worker for those. Do not invent per-vendor apply adapters when a single HTTPS
registration request is enough. The owner can also reveal and paste the URL from
package settings.

## Ingress URL

`GET|POST https://<origin>/@<username>/webhooks/<packageKodyId>/<webhookName>/<urlSecret>`

- Unknown / unminted / disabled / renamed-away / wrong secret → **404** (no
  distinction).
- `GET` is allowed only when the webhook declares a GET-capable
  [`challenge`](#subscription-challenges); otherwise **405**.
- Payload > **1 MB** → **413**.
- Rate limit per minted webhook → **429**. Default **60**/min; override with
  `rateLimitPerMinute` up to **600**.
- `ack`: **202** `{ "ok": true }` after Kody durably queues the delivery; the
  export runs in the background. Bodies use the same **1 MB** cap as sync;
  oversized queue messages spill to ephemeral storage until the consumer runs. A
  temporary queue failure returns **503** so the provider can retry without Kody
  claiming acceptance. Activity duration for ack deliveries measures queue
  consumer + export time (ingress receive time is kept as metadata). Failed
  deliveries keep diagnostic logs — including when the export never reached user
  code.
- `sync`: waits for the export JSON result (**502** on failure).

Background delivery retries keep the same idempotency key, so a transient
platform persistence failure does not duplicate a completed export. Package
exports still have the normal execution limit (about 90 seconds); packages that
exceed it receive an explicit timeout failure and should split or checkpoint
their work.

## Subscription challenges

Some providers prove URL ownership with a fixed quiz before they send events:
HMAC a challenge token, echo a hub challenge, or return a JSON challenge field.
Kody answers those on the minted webhook URL **in the platform** — the bound
export never runs for the quiz, and challenge handling does not mutate account
state, call MCP, or fetch outbound.

Declare one `challenge` object next to (or instead of, when the provider has no
POST HMAC) `verification`. Use the generic `subscription-challenge` type with
knobs, or copy a documented preset below.

### Generic `subscription-challenge`

| Knob        | Role                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `method`    | `GET` or `POST`                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `challenge` | Where the token arrives: `{ in: "query" \| "json", key }`                                                                                                                                |
| `when`      | Optional filters (`query` / `json`). GET mismatch → **400**; POST mismatch → not a quiz (delivery continues). **Required for POST** (`when.json`) so ordinary event bodies fall through. |
| `prove`     | `none`, `verify-token` (query secret match), `hmac` (CRC of token), or `request-hmac` (sign the request)                                                                                 |
| `respond`   | `text` echo, `json` echo under `key`, or `json-hmac` (CRC response)                                                                                                                      |

`prove.*.secretName` is the same named secret-store reference as
`verification.secretName` — never an inline value. Later provider POSTs still go
through normal URL-secret + optional HMAC verification; only verified deliveries
reach the export.

Platform schema stays vendor-agnostic
([0054](../contributing/decisions/0054-no-vendor-specific-platform-logic.md)):
configure providers with knobs or documented presets, not new `foo-hub` type
ids.

### Presets (copy into `challenge`)

**Hub echo as `text/plain` (Meta / Facebook / WhatsApp-style):**

```json
{
	"type": "subscription-challenge",
	"method": "GET",
	"challenge": { "in": "query", "key": "hub.challenge" },
	"when": { "query": { "hub.mode": "subscribe" } },
	"prove": {
		"kind": "verify-token",
		"in": "query",
		"key": "hub.verify_token",
		"secretName": "metaVerifyToken"
	},
	"respond": { "as": "text" }
}
```

**Hub echo as JSON `{ "hub.challenge" }` (Strava-style):**

```json
{
	"type": "subscription-challenge",
	"method": "GET",
	"challenge": { "in": "query", "key": "hub.challenge" },
	"when": { "query": { "hub.mode": "subscribe" } },
	"prove": {
		"kind": "verify-token",
		"in": "query",
		"key": "hub.verify_token",
		"secretName": "stravaVerifyToken"
	},
	"respond": { "as": "json", "key": "hub.challenge" }
}
```

Store the same `verify_token` value you pass when creating the Strava push
subscription. Mint the webhook, register the revealed URL as `callback_url`, and
pass that secret as `verify_token` on create.

**WebSub / YouTube hub (optional verify token; allows unsubscribe):**

```json
{
	"type": "subscription-challenge",
	"method": "GET",
	"challenge": { "in": "query", "key": "hub.challenge" },
	"when": { "query": { "hub.mode": ["subscribe", "unsubscribe"] } },
	"respond": { "as": "text" }
}
```

Add a `prove.verify-token` block with `secretName` when the hub sends
`hub.verify_token`.

**CRC of query token → JSON HMAC field (X Account Activity-style):**

```json
{
	"type": "subscription-challenge",
	"method": "GET",
	"challenge": { "in": "query", "key": "crc_token" },
	"prove": {
		"kind": "hmac",
		"secretName": "xConsumerSecret",
		"algorithm": "hmac-sha256",
		"encoding": "base64",
		"prefix": "sha256="
	},
	"respond": { "as": "json-hmac", "key": "response_token" }
}
```

**JSON body challenge + optional request signature (Slack Events-style):**

```json
{
	"type": "subscription-challenge",
	"method": "POST",
	"challenge": { "in": "json", "key": "challenge" },
	"when": { "json": { "type": "url_verification" } },
	"prove": {
		"kind": "request-hmac",
		"secretName": "slackSigningSecret",
		"algorithm": "hmac-sha256",
		"encoding": "hex",
		"prefix": "v0=",
		"timestampHeader": "x-slack-request-timestamp",
		"signatureHeader": "x-slack-signature",
		"signedPayload": "v0.timestamp.body"
	},
	"respond": { "as": "json", "key": "challenge" }
}
```

When `prove` is omitted, the platform echoes without a signature check. Event
POSTs still use the normal delivery path — declare a matching `verification`
block when those deliveries must also verify request signing.

### X Activity (CRC) example for `@kentcdodds/x`

```json
{
	"name": "activity-event",
	"export": "./activity-event",
	"challenge": {
		"type": "subscription-challenge",
		"method": "GET",
		"challenge": { "in": "query", "key": "crc_token" },
		"prove": {
			"kind": "hmac",
			"secretName": "xConsumerSecret",
			"algorithm": "hmac-sha256",
			"encoding": "base64",
			"prefix": "sha256="
		},
		"respond": { "as": "json-hmac", "key": "response_token" }
	},
	"verification": {
		"type": "hmac-sha256",
		"header": "X-Twitter-Webhooks-Signature",
		"secretName": "xConsumerSecret",
		"encoding": "base64",
		"prefix": "sha256="
	}
}
```

Store the X consumer secret with `secretSet` under `xConsumerSecret`, mint the
webhook, then register the revealed URL directly with X. CRC GETs never invoke
`./activity-event`; activity POSTs do, after HMAC verification.

## Payload shape seen by the package export

```ts
{
	webhook: {
		packageKodyId: string
		name: string
		receivedAt: string // ISO timestamp
	}
	request: {
		method: string
		contentType: string | null
		headers: Record<string, string> // safe allowlisted subset, lowercase keys
		body: string // raw text
		json: unknown | null
	}
}
```

Example export:

```js
export async function handleSentryWebhook(input) {
	const event = input.request.json
	// ... automate ...
	return { ok: true }
}
```

## Signature verification examples

### Sentry

```json
{
	"type": "hmac-sha256",
	"header": "sentry-hook-signature",
	"secretName": "sentryWebhookSecret",
	"encoding": "hex"
}
```

### GitHub

Omit `secretName` so `webhookUrlMint` stores package-owned HMAC on the URL
record (not in account secrets). Use `{{webhookSecret}}` on apply:

```json
{
	"type": "hmac-sha256",
	"header": "x-hub-signature-256",
	"encoding": "hex",
	"prefix": "sha256="
}
```

GitHub HMAC covers the raw body only. Add `replay.deliveryIdHeader` so a
replayed `X-GitHub-Delivery` is acknowledged without running the export again:

```json
{
	"name": "github",
	"export": "./handle-github-webhook",
	"verification": {
		"type": "hmac-sha256",
		"header": "x-hub-signature-256",
		"encoding": "hex",
		"prefix": "sha256="
	},
	"replay": {
		"deliveryIdHeader": "X-GitHub-Delivery"
	}
}
```

### Stripe

Stripe signs `` `${t}.${rawBody}` `` and sends both the unix timestamp and HMAC
in `Stripe-Signature`. Declare `signedPayload: "timestamp.body"` and a timestamp
window:

```json
{
	"name": "stripe",
	"export": "./handle-stripe-webhook",
	"verification": {
		"type": "hmac-sha256",
		"header": "Stripe-Signature",
		"secretName": "stripeWebhookSecret",
		"encoding": "hex",
		"signedPayload": "timestamp.body"
	},
	"replay": {
		"timestampHeader": "Stripe-Signature",
		"timestampFormat": "stripe-signature",
		"toleranceSeconds": 300
	}
}
```

`stripe-signature` reads `t=<unix>` from the header. Deliveries whose timestamp
is missing, unparseable, or older than `toleranceSeconds` (default 300) are
rejected with the same generic 401 as a bad HMAC.

## Synthetic smoke test

After mint, smoke-test the bound export from **interactive MCP** with
`webhookSyntheticDispatch` instead of POSTing a real provider delivery to
yourself. Search the `webhooks` domain, then call:

```json
{
	"kodyId": "@you/sentry-bridge",
	"webhookName": "sentry",
	"request": {
		"json": { "action": "created" }
	}
}
```

For `inputMode: "params"` webhooks, pass `params` (the first-arg object) instead
of `request`. The platform skips the public URL and HMAC path, marks the
Activity webhook run `synthetic: true`, and counts the invoke against automation
usage like a normal delivery. **Side effects are real.** The capability is
owner-only and unavailable from package jobs, subscriptions, webhooks, or other
package runtimes. It never returns `url` / `url_secret`.

Do not confuse platform synthetic dispatch with a package-local `dryRun` field
on trusted-client POSTs — those are unrelated contracts. Sibling fields such as
`route` and `dryRun` on `params`-mode fixtures are preserved for the export; the
platform only sets top-level `synthetic: true`.

## Trusted clients

A first-party caller (Discord gateway proxy, YouTube WebSub worker, Raycast
extension, social-launch client) mints a webhook URL and POSTs JSON. No
`Authorization: Bearer`. One webhook per export they actually call.

```json
{
	"name": "message-created",
	"export": "./dispatch-message-created",
	"responseMode": "sync",
	"inputMode": "params",
	"rateLimitPerMinute": 600
}
```

Use `sync` when the caller needs the export JSON (or a **409** idempotency
conflict). Use `ack` when the caller only needs acceptance; the queue consumer
applies the same idempotency ledger.

`inputMode: "params"` passes a JSON object as the export's **first argument**,
matching invocation-token `params`. If the body is the invoke envelope
(`{ "params": { … } }` with optional `idempotencyKey`, `source`, and `topic`),
the platform unwraps `params`. `idempotencyKey` counts only as a non-empty
string, and `source` / `topic` only as a string or null. A top-level JSON object
that is not that envelope is the first argument as-is, so sibling fields such as
`route` and `dryRun` stay visible even when a nested `params` object is present.
Arrays and non-objects are **400** `invalid_params`. Default
`inputMode: "request"` is unchanged: the export still receives
`{ webhook, request }`.

Send **`Idempotency-Key`** (standard header). In `params` mode, JSON
`idempotencyKey` is accepted when the header is absent. Same key + same payload
replays the stored result. On `sync`, a different payload is **409**
`idempotency_mismatch` and an in-progress key is **409**
`invocation_in_progress`. `ack` still returns **202** after enqueue; the
consumer records the ledger outcome. This works without HMAC — the URL secret is
the credential.

Caller keys use the same package-invocation idempotency ledger as
`replay.deliveryIdHeader`. Delivery-id keys still match by id alone (vendor
retries change `receivedAt`). Caller keys hash the payload: in `params` mode
that is the export first argument; in `request` mode it is the JSON body so
`receivedAt` does not break retries.

Do not declare a `*` webhook. A client that calls several exports gets one
webhook declaration per export.

## Lifecycle

Republishing a package that removes or renames a webhook deactivates that
ingress (unknown name → 404). Disable with `webhookDisable` without deleting the
mint; re-enable with `webhookEnable`. Rotate the URL secret with
`webhookUrlRotate` when a credential may have leaked, then call
`webhookUrlApply` again with the same handle so providers get the new URL. The
[settings card](#manage-webhook-urls-in-package-settings) describes the 24-hour
/ first-accepted-delivery overlap. The same disable, enable, and rotate actions
are in that Webhooks section.
