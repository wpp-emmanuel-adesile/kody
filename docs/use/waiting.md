# Waiting

Waiting is the current-state queue of things only **you** can clear. Open
**`/account/waiting`** from Account while signed in. Desktop puts Account in the
header to the left of the avatar; the avatar goes to your public profile
(`/@username`).

Items are derived from live account state. They disappear when the gate clears.
There is no read/unread mark, archive, or notification table.

The empty state is **Nothing is waiting on you.**

## What shows up

Typical items:

- verify your email (outbound mail stays off until you confirm)
- finish OAuth or reconnect an MCP server that is authenticating, failed, or
  disconnected — unless the error looks like a vendor outage
- reconnect a third-party grant that last refresh classified as yours to fix
  (`invalid_grant`, missing user credential, or a missing refresh token on a
  sign-in that expires; a non-expiring grant such as a GitHub OAuth App token
  with no refresh token is healthy and does not appear)
- update an expired user-scope secret (up to three, then a “more” card)
- review a locked package (published code stays put until you promote or unlock)
- confirm a pending email change
- a plan resource at its cap
- an elevated **open** error rate (one card that points at Activity; ignored and
  resolved runs do not keep it around)
- unfinished wizard resume cards (`connect-agent`, `connect-second-agent`)
  unless you dismissed the checklist on Get started
- discrete first-use setup cards until each gate clears: first search, first
  memory, first execute, first saved package, first job, first connected
  integration grant, first user-scope secret, and official Kody Discord
  membership (Connect Discord on `/discord`)

The `/onboarding` wizard is Steps 1–3 plus the derived checklist
(`verify-email`, `connect-agent`, `give-access`, `connect-second-agent`,
`install-starter`). Discord membership and the first-use items above are Waiting
cards, not wizard steps. Coarse checklist cards for `give-access` and
`install-starter` do not appear here — they overlap first search / memory /
execute / package.

First-use cards are independent of checklist dismiss. A probe that errors is
treated as unknown: Waiting neither invents that card nor claims the gate
cleared. Discord membership is official-guild membership as Kody can see it
(Discord social login plus a live member read). No Discord connection shows the
card. A linked account whose membership cannot be checked (bot unset, API blip)
fails open and hides the card, because login already attempted `guilds.join`.

Vendor outages, operator work, and other people's queues do not appear here.
Session-scoped secret approvals stay on the session that requested them. Missing
secret _names_ stay off Waiting (the agent’s `nextStep` and
`/connect/secret-set` already cover those).

OAuth last-failure **is** stored on the connection. A reconnectable grant shows
a Waiting card with Reconnect. A provider 5xx or timeout is stored for
[Integrations](https://kody.codes/account/integrations) as a service issue, but
it does not appear here and does not emit `integration.auth.failed`.

## Not Activity, not Email

- **[Activity](./activity.md)** is run history: jobs, apps, webhooks, and
  triage. Waiting does not copy that error list.
- **[Email](./email-primitives.md)** is your mailbox. Waiting does not send
  mail.

## Ask your agent

`waitingSummary` lives on the existing `account` domain. It returns the same
self-scoped items as the page. Use `runSummary` when you want Activity.
