  How to let a spouse or friend talk to *your agent* over a familiar chat
  surface (iMessage worked example). Surface vs brain vs home: the agent holds

# Text your agent

Your spouse or a friend can text your agent from iMessage, SMS, or Discord and
get answers shaped by your preferences, calendars, and packages. The
conversation happens with an **agent**. That agent reaches into Kody for the
durable stuff: memory, secrets, packages, jobs, and webhooks. Keep those three
layers straight and "text my robot" becomes a wiring problem you can solve with
tools that already exist.

[What is Kody?](./what-is-kody.md) describes how your agent and Kody split the
work in general. This page is the worked example for a chat surface.

## The three layers

Name them once and keep them:

| Layer            | What it is                                    | Examples                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Surface**      | Where humans already talk                     | iMessage, SMS, Discord, Slack, email                              |
| **Brain**        | The agent host that holds the conversation    | OpenClaw, OpenMuse, Pi, Grok Bot / Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, Codex |
| **Tools / home** | Shared durable state the agent calls over MCP | Kody (memory, secrets, packages, jobs, webhooks)                  |

The surface never has to know about Kody. Kody never has to become a chat app.
The brain sits in the middle: it receives the human message, reasons, calls Kody
when it needs tools or memory, and replies on the same surface. Some personal
agents bring their own surface too (a phone or web chat), and the split stays
the same.

## Worked example: iMessage

Goal: your partner texts a number or Apple ID they already know, and _your_
agent answers with your preferences, calendars, and packages in mind.

### 1. Pick a brain that already speaks a messaging surface

Prefer an agent-native channel. The agent stays the brain; Kody stays the tools.

- **OpenClaw** - the
  [`@openclaw/imessage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openclaw/imessage)
  plugin plus the [`imsg`](https://github.com/openclaw/imsg) CLI. The gateway
  talks to Messages through `imsg rpc` (JSON-RPC over stdio) on a Mac signed
  into Messages, or through an SSH wrapper that runs `imsg` on that Mac. It
  reads `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` (needs Full Disk Access) and can send
  through Messages Automation. Richer features may need the `imsg launch`
  helper. See [OpenClaw iMessage](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels/imessage).
- **Bezalel** - hosted capability plane over MCP (URL + bearer). iMessage shows
  up as a paired line; inbound events wake agents through an event router.
  Texting goes through Photon Spectrum: managed iMessage lines in the cloud, so
  no personal Mac is required. See [Bezalel docs](https://bezalel.sh/docs.md)
  and [privacy](https://bezalel.sh/privacy.md).
- **Grok Bot / Cursor (and similar hosts)** - same architecture on a different
  surface. In the official Kody Discord, `@Kody` / a grok-bot wake hands the
  message to an agent; the agent replies in-channel. See
  [`@kentcdodds/grok-bot`](https://kody.codes/@kentcdodds/grok-bot).

There is no official personal iMessage API from Apple. Something has to bridge
Messages (or a hosted line) into the agent. That bridge is the hard part. The
Kody side - webhook ingress, normalize, optional wake - is the easy part and
looks like Discord or AgentMail event packages.

### 2. Connect that agent to Kody over MCP

Use [Connect your agent](./connect-your-agent.md). After connect, the same agent
that answers iMessage can `search` and `execute` against your account: memories
travel, secrets stay unread, packages and jobs keep running while the phone
conversation continues.

### 3. Decide who is allowed to talk to it

A spouse texting "what's for dinner" is a different trust boundary than a public
Discord help channel. Scope the surface (contacts, allowlists, a dedicated line)
in the agent host. Use Kody [secrets](./secrets.md) and package locks when the
agent should act with your credentials without ever reading them.

## Realistic iMessage bridges

If your chosen brain does not already own iMessage, you still need a bridge:

| Approach                                                            | Fit                                  | Notes                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Photon Spectrum** (managed iMessage lines in the cloud)           | Hosted-line model, no personal Mac   | What Bezalel-style setups and adapters use; see [Photon iMessage](https://photon.codes/platform/imessage) |
| **BlueBubbles** (self-hosted on a Mac you control)                  | Historical / self-hosted alternative | REST/webhooks into your own agent or a Kody package if you already run a BlueBubbles Mac.                 |
| **AirMessage / DIY Mac helper** (Shortcuts, AppleScript, `chat.db`) | Fragile                              | Works until an OS update; treat as temporary                                                              |
| **Pure cloud "just works"**                                         | Not available                        | Something always bridges or hosts a line                                                                  |

A later optional Kody package could wrap Photon webhooks the way Discord and
AgentMail packages do. Prefer agent-native channels first unless you
specifically want events landing in Kody packages with no model in the loop
([Jobs, workflows, and webhooks](./triggers.md)).

## Simpler path: SMS without blue bubbles

When blue-bubble iMessage is not required, use a normal phone number.

[`@kody/twilio`](https://kody.codes/@kody/twilio) is the existing SMS lane:
inbound SMS can wake a workflow or package; your agent (or a no-model job)
replies. Same three layers - surface is SMS, brain is still your agent (or a
deterministic package), tools are still Kody.

## Parallel: Discord in the official Kody server

Community chat often wants the same shape:

1. Human posts in Discord (surface).
2. `@Kody` or a grok-bot wake reaches an agent (brain).
3. That agent calls Kody packages and memory (tools), then replies in-thread.

Same split as iMessage. Different surface. See
[`@kentcdodds/grok-bot`](https://kody.codes/@kentcdodds/grok-bot).

## What to build vs what not to wait for

**Do this now**

1. Choose a brain that already speaks the surface you care about.
2. Connect it to Kody ([Connect your agent](./connect-your-agent.md)).
3. Give trusted humans access on that surface only.
4. Teach the agent to reach for Kody for memory and packages instead of stuffing
   state into one chat host.

**Skip waiting for**

- A "chat with Kody" inbox. That would invert the product.
- A pure cloud personal iMessage API. Apple does not offer one for this use.

**Optional later**

- A Kody package that normalizes Photon webhooks (or a self-hosted BlueBubbles
  server) into the same event shape Discord already uses, so jobs can run with
  no model in the loop.

## Where to go next

- [What is Kody?](./what-is-kody.md) - how your agent and Kody split the work
- [Packages, integrations, and MCP servers](./packages-integrations-mcp.md) -
  keep those three from collapsing into each other
- [Connect your agent](./connect-your-agent.md) - wire the brain to the home
- [Jobs, workflows, and webhooks](./triggers.md) - when the surface should knock
  on a package instead of waking a model
