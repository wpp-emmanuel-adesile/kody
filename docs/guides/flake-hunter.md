summary:
  Homepage cron example: a package-owned daily job that scans CI for flaky
  end-to-end runs, stays quiet on a clean day, and only acts when a flake
  signal is present. Load this when someone asks how Flake Hunter works or how
  to hang a schedule on a package they own.

# Flake Hunter

The homepage **Trigger it** card labeled Cron is this example. A schedule is
optional, not the product. The product is a package you own that can run while
your laptop is closed, with no model in the loop and no tokens spent.

Live public package:
[`@kentcdodds/e2e-flake-hunter`](https://kody.codes/@kentcdodds/e2e-flake-hunter).
Fork that public package when you want the same hunt on your repo. The primitive
is documented in [Jobs, workflows, and webhooks](./triggers.md).

## The job

Every day at 4am America/Denver, the published package scans the last 24 hours
of GitHub Actions jobs on `kentcdodds/kody`. If any job indicates e2e flakiness,
it starts **one** investigation. A clean day is silent.

That is the factory loop from [How Kody works](./how-kody-works.md) aimed at CI
noise: ask once, save the scan, trigger it on a cron.

Kent's copy also spawns one Cursor Cloud Agent when a flake signal is present.
Obvious fixes ship through the repo's ship-pr path. A non-obvious flake becomes
a written recommendation emailed to Kent with a link to the investigating agent.
Your fork can stop at "scan and notify" if you do not want an agent spawned.

That is the usual split between Kody and an agent: the package does the daily
watching with no model, and an agent is called only when there is something
worth reasoning about.

## Package shape

Declare the schedule in `package.json#kody.jobs` so it travels with the code it
runs:

```json
{
	"kody": {
		"jobs": {
			"daily": {
				"entry": "./src/daily.ts",
				"schedule": { "type": "cron", "expression": "0 4 * * *" },
				"timezone": "America/Denver",
				"enabled": false
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Publish with `"enabled": false`. The entry is a no-argument wrapper. The usual
shape is a thin module that calls a callable export and notifies only when there
is news:

```ts
import sweep from './sweep.ts'

export default async function daily() {
	return await sweep()
}
```

Keep the scan itself callable from `execute` so you can prove it before the
clock does:

```ts
import scan from 'kody:@you/e2e-flake-hunter/scan'

export default async function main() {
	return await scan()
}
```

- Shared implementation accepts an optional cursor (`since` / last seen run id)
  and returns `{ flakes, message }`.
- A read-only `./scan` export never spawns work and never sends mail. Use it
  from chat and from the scheduled wrapper's dry path.
- A `./sweep` export runs the scan, records the newest run id in
  `packageStorage()`, and only then starts one investigation or `emailSend`.
- `emailSend` only mails the account's own verified address. Skip it when
  `flakes.length === 0`. An empty digest every morning trains people to ignore
  the real one.
- Each job run gets a job-scoped scratch bucket. The cursor belongs in
  `packageStorage()`, not in the scratch bucket.

`jobRunNow` fires one run for debugging. `jobUpdate` flips `enabled` after that
run looks right. Name and source stay in the repo.

## Example prompts

Paste one of these into an agent already connected to your Kody account.

**Build one**

> Search Kody for flake hunter and official job guides. I want a daily cron that
> scans the last 24 hours of GitHub Actions jobs on this repo for e2e flakes.
> Stay quiet when the day is clean. If a flake signal is present, record it and
> mail me once. Publish with the job disabled, invoke the wrapper from execute,
> then enable it only after that run looks right.

**Fork the public one**

> Open https://kody.codes/@kentcdodds/e2e-flake-hunter, fork it into my account,
> and adapt it to my repo. Keep the daily job disabled until we have invoked
> `./daily` once. Prefer `./scan` for the first check. Do not disable a live job
> on Kent's package.

**Operate an existing copy**

> Import `kody:@me/e2e-flake-hunter/status` and tell me whether today's sweep
> ran, whether the kill switch is on, and what the last outcome was. If I want
> it quiet for a bit, use `./pause` rather than disabling the job.
