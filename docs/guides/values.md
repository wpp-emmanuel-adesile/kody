# Persist named state

Use the destination that matches the job. Do not invent a thinner kv primitive.

## Destination map

| Job                                  | Destination           | How                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Durable facts and preferences        | memories              | `metaMemoryVerify`, then `metaMemoryUpsert`. Verify-first; do not upsert blindly. |
| Package runtime state, caches, knobs | `packageStorage()`    | `get` / `set` (or SQL) in the owning package.                                     |
| Versioned calibration or documents   | a repo                | Edit the package repo or a plain repo; live-at-HEAD for plain repos.              |
| API keys, PATs, HMAC secrets         | secrets               | Prefill `/connect/secret-set?...` - never paste into chat.                        |
| OAuth connections and their tokens   | integrations          | `/connect/oauth?provider=...` or `integration_*`.                                 |
| Ids several packages share           | owning package export | One package holds the id; others statically import that export.                   |

Access and refresh tokens live on the connection — not as separately named
secrets. See [Secrets and host approval](../use/secrets-and-values.md) and the
[OAuth guide](./oauth.md).

`packageStorage().get` / `set` is the named-read API for package state.
