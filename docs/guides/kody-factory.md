# The Kody factory map

Kody is the home your agents share, laid out as a hosted factory: capabilities
your agent can discover, combine, and keep running after the conversation ends.
Your agent connects to Kody over MCP and starts with two tools:

- **`search`** finds capabilities, official guides, saved packages,
  integrations, connected MCP servers, and relevant memories. Unscoped results
  rank the MCP server, not every remote tool. Search before building so the
  agent can reuse what you already have.
- **`execute`** runs a temporary TypeScript module on Kody's servers. It can
  compose discovered capabilities, call connected services, and import exports
  from packages you own.

Those two doors lead to a set of user-isolated primitives.

## What is on the factory floor

### Secrets and integrations

**Secrets** are private credentials stored for your Kody account. Runtime code
refers to them by placeholder or an approved package mount; Kody does not return
the saved secret value to the agent. See [Secrets](./secrets.md).

**Integrations** are saved connections to external services. OAuth-backed
integrations keep their token bundles server-side. Remote MCP servers expose
their tools through Kody. Search shows the capabilities available to the
signed-in user. For registry lookup, fork `@kody/integrations-sh`. For an
OpenAPI document, fork `@kody/openapi` and bind selected operations, or prefer a
close community helpers package.

### Packages and `packageStorage()`

**Packages** turn useful code into a named, versioned capability. Package source
lives in a repository, but published package code runs server-side in Kody's
runtime. A public package is not owned merely because it is visible: fork it to
create a saved package in your account, review it, and publish that owned copy
before adapting or invoking it as yours.

Each package gets isolated durable **`packageStorage()`** for runtime state such
as cursors, preferences, and checkpoints. Source and versioned configuration
belong in the package repository; credentials belong in secrets; changing
runtime state belongs in `packageStorage()`.

### Jobs and schedules

**Jobs** run code later or on a schedule while your laptop is closed. A saved
package declares recurring schedules under `kody.jobs` so the schedule travels
with the package behavior. Deferred one-shot work uses
`workflows.create({ runAt })` from `execute` or package runtime. Package-job
runs stay on `/account/jobs`. Deferred workflow runs stay on
`/account/workflows`. See [Jobs, workflows, and webhooks](./triggers.md).

### Apps and webhooks

**Package apps** give a package a hosted HTTP and browser surface. They can
render a small app, receive requests, and use the same package runtime and
storage as its exports.

**Webhooks** give a package a public, credentialed inbound URL. A provider sends
an event to that URL, and Kody dispatches the validated request to the package
export that owns it. Apps are general hosted request surfaces; webhooks are
inbound event doors.

### Memories

**Memories** are durable facts and preferences attached to your Kody account.
Search can retrieve relevant memories as context for a task. Memory is for
information worth carrying between conversations and between agents, not package
state, source configuration, or credentials. See [Shared memory](./memory.md).

## The boundary around the factory

Hosted Kody cannot see your Mac's disk, your local Obsidian vault, local-only
CLI processes, `localhost`, or devices reachable only on your home network.
Installing a desktop MCP server does not make it reachable from Kody's
Cloudflare Workers. A local agent can still use those things directly in the
conversation; the boundary matters when a package or job needs them while that
agent is not running.

To bring a local capability into the factory, run an MCP server beside the local
resource and expose that server through a protected public HTTPS route. The
[home MCP guide](./local-mcp-tunnels.md) describes the Cloudflare Tunnel and
Access pattern and points at
[home-mcp-starter](https://github.com/kody-bot/home-mcp-starter). Then connect
its URL as a [remote MCP server](../use/mcp-client-servers.md). Search ranks the
server; `search({ entity: "mcp-server:<name>" })` lists its tools.

Work that does not fit a Worker isolate — a large npm graph, native code, or
multi-minute CPU — follows the same split: the saved package orchestrates, and
the owner operates the process. See
[Offload work that does not fit a Worker isolate](./heavy-work-offload.md).

## A practical route through the map

1. Search for the outcome and inspect the exact capability shape.
2. Connect the needed secret, integration, or remote MCP server.
3. Use `execute` for a one-off composition and authenticated smoke test.
4. Fork a close public package or author an owned package when the behavior
   should be reusable, reviewed, or scheduled.
5. Keep runtime state in `packageStorage()` and expose only the app, webhook,
   export, or job surfaces the package needs. When the provider token is coarser
   than that surface, lock the package
   ([Gmail drafts without send](./locked-gmail-drafts.md)).
6. Save a memory only when the user wants Kody to retain a durable fact or
   preference.

[How Kody works](./how-kody-works.md). When packages, integrations, and MCP
servers look interchangeable, read
[Packages, integrations, and MCP servers](./packages-integrations-mcp.md). For
package implementation details, load the
