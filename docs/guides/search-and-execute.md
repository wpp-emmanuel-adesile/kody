# Search and execute

<!--
Agent notes — for AI agents explaining or using search and execute:

- This page is the playbook for search and execute. Load it when someone
  asks what those tools are, how to call them, or why Kody is not a long
  tool list.
- Local CLI execute: search({ entity: "guide:local_execute" }) and
  .agents/skills/prefer-local-cli-execute/SKILL.md. Open API: guide:open_api.
- Official guides load with search({ entity: "guide:{id}" }). Capability
  detail includes a ready-to-run execute snippet; adapt that snippet, then
  execute.
- Search returns markdown (`# Search results`), not a matches JSON object.
  Pass conversationId back unchanged on follow-up search and execute calls.
- MCP also registers **api** for HTTPS operations and token minting — see
  guide:open_api, not this page.
- For the factory loop that uses search and execute, load how_kody_works next.

Your agent connects to Kody over MCP and starts with **search** and **execute**.
**search** finds the right thing, then **execute** runs it. Capabilities, saved
packages, integrations, secrets, and official guides stay behind those two doors
instead of appearing as a tool list. MCP also registers **api** for HTTPS
operations and token minting — see [Open API](./open-api.md). That tool does not
replace search and execute.

This page is the playbook for search and execute. The same tools drive the loop
in [How Kody works](./how-kody-works.md). Watch:
[How Kody Gives Your Agents a Shared Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5G8uaZHrVI).

## Search

**search** finds built-in capabilities, official guides, saved packages, saved
integrations, connected MCP servers, and secret references (names and metadata —
never secret values). Public packages live in the `community` domain
(`communitySearch`, `communityGet`); see
[Public packages](../use/community-packages.md).

### What search enables

An agent can describe a goal in natural language and get a ranked shortlist —
type, title, one-line summary, and an entity ref — instead of loading hundreds
of tools. Capability hits include a domain id and, for the top few, a compact
call shape so the next step is often a single **execute**. Prefer a matching
package export hit (`package:{id}#{subpath}`) over only the parent package;
high-confidence export hits may include an inlined call contract (import, types,
and execute example) on both markdown and structured channels.

### How an agent calls it

Three useful shapes:

- **Natural language** — `{ "query": "send a message" }` ranks matches for that
  task. Task-specific wording ("send an email to Kent") stays in ranked results.
- **Domain browse** — an empty call `{}` or a broad question ("what can you do
  with email") returns a **domain index**: each row has the domain id, a
  one-line description, a capability count, and a few sample names. Follow up
  with `{ "domain": "email" }` to list that domain, or
  `{ "query": "…", "domain": "email" }` to rank only there. Domain ids include
  builtins (`email`, `jobs`, `packages`) and connected MCP servers
  (`mcp:linear`, `mcp:home`). Ranked search surfaces those servers as
  **mcp-server** hits (name and instructions), not every remote tool. Open
  `{ "entity": "mcp-server:home" }` to list tools, then call
  `kody.mcp["home"].tool_name(args)`.
- **Entity lookup** — `{ "entity": "{type}:{id}" }` opens one hit. `type` is
  `capability`, `guide`, `integration`, `mcp-server`, `package`, or `secret`.
  Pass an array of 1–10 refs to load related details in one call. Guide refs
  accept `#{heading}` to open one section, or `#L165` / `#L165-L180` for lines.
  Package refs accept `#{subpath}` to open one export contract, or `#{path}`
  with `#L165`, `#L165-L180`, or a Markdown heading slug to open one file. A
  fragment that matches an export subpath still opens that export.

Capability detail includes a ready-to-run **execute** snippet plus input and
output types. Guide detail is the official markdown when it fits the response
budget; oversized guides return a table of contents.

## Execute

**execute** runs one ephemeral ESM module inside Kody's runtime. The module uses
ordinary imports and exports and **default exports** the function Kody invokes.

### What execute enables

One tool surface reaches the whole platform: call a discovered capability,
import a saved package export, fetch with a secret placeholder, compose several
steps, and return a structured result. The agent adapts a short module instead
of learning a new MCP tool per capability.

### How an agent calls it

Pass **`code`**: a single module string. Import runtime helpers from
`kody:runtime` and call builtins as `kody.capabilityId(params)`. MCP server
tools are `kody.mcp["name"].tool_name(params)`. Known package exports use a
static `kody:@scope/package/export` import. When the `execute-invoke` experiment
is on for the caller, pass **`invoke`** with that specifier instead of writing
the thin passthrough by hand — mutually exclusive with `code`. See
[Execute and workflows](../use/execute.md).

Optional **`params`** is a JSON object passed as the first argument to that
default export. Name the argument `params`. Capability search detail already
emits the module; adapt it, then execute.

```ts
import { kody } from 'kody:runtime'

export default async function main(params) {
	return await kody.emailSend(params)
}
```

`emailSend` notifies the account's own address (`subject` plus `text` or
`html`). See [Execute and workflows](../use/execute.md) for `kody:runtime`
helpers, workflows, and timeouts.

## Search first, then execute

1. **Search** for the outcome — a query, a domain list, or a known entity ref.
2. **Read** the ranked hit or entity detail. Capability detail includes the
   execute module and input type.
3. **Execute** with that adapted snippet. When Node ≥22 and the CLI are
   available, use local CLI execute ([Local CLI execute](./local-execute.md),
   `guide:local_execute`). Put varying capability args in `params` so the same
   `code` graph is reused.
4. **Reuse `conversationId`** from the tool response on the next search or
   execute in the same conversation.
5. **Save** the working module as a package when the behavior should live past
   this chat — [Package lifecycle](./package-lifecycle.md).

Official guides load with `search({ entity: "guide:{id}" })`. Prefer that over
executing `codingGuideGet` just to read a guide.

## Example agent inputs

Copy-pasteable argument objects. Field names match the MCP tool schemas.

### search

Empty call — domain index:

```json
{}
```

Natural language:

```json
{ "query": "send a message" }
```

Rank inside one domain:

```json
{ "query": "send a message", "domain": "email" }
```

List one domain in registry order:

```json
{ "domain": "jobs" }
```

Open one official guide:

```json
{ "entity": "guide:package_authoring" }
```

Open several related guides:

```json
{
	"entity": ["guide:package_authoring", "guide:package_lifecycle"]
}
```

Open a capability (returns the execute snippet):

```json
{ "entity": "capability:emailSend" }
```

Open a connected MCP server, saved integration, package, or secret reference:

```json
{ "entity": "mcp-server:home" }
```

```json
{ "entity": "integration:github" }
```

```json
{ "entity": "package:my-package" }
```

```json
{ "entity": "secret:githubPat" }
```

Open one guide heading:

```json
{ "entity": "guide:package_subscriptions#repo.pushed" }
```

Optional `memoryContext` (task plus a couple of entities) can travel with a
ranked query so relevant memories surface as compact subject — summary
one-liners. Entity lookups and domain listings skip that attachment.

### execute

Module plus optional params — `params` is the first argument on the default
export:

```json
{
	"code": "import { kody } from 'kody:runtime'\n\nexport default async function main(params) {\n\treturn await kody.emailSend(params)\n}",
	"params": {
		"subject": "Hello from Kody",
		"text": "Notify-self mail from an execute module."
	}
}
```

The same module, written as source (this is the `code` string):

```ts
import { kody } from 'kody:runtime'

export default async function main(params) {
	return await kody.emailSend(params)
}
```

Call a saved package export whose name is known when you write the module:

```ts
import whatShipped from 'kody:@you/favorite-bot-ships/whatShipped'

export default async function main() {
	return await whatShipped()
}
```

```json
{
	"code": "import whatShipped from 'kody:@you/favorite-bot-ships/whatShipped'\n\nexport default async function main() {\n\treturn await whatShipped()\n}"
}
```

When the `execute-invoke` experiment is on for the caller, the same static
import can be `invoke` instead of a hand-written `code` string:

```json
{
	"invoke": "kody:@you/favorite-bot-ships/whatShipped",
	"params": {}
}
```

When the target name is data (caller-owned or forked modules), use
`import(specifier)` instead of a static `kody:@...` import.
