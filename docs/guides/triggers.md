title: Jobs, workflows, and webhooks
summary:
  How work runs when nobody is in the chat. Package-owned jobs for recurring
  schedules, workflows for deferred or long one-shot runs, inbound webhooks for
  provider events, subscriptions for events inside Kody, and the inbox — which
  to pick, how each is declared, and how to test one safely before enabling it.
  Load this when someone asks how to run something later, on a schedule, or when

# Jobs, workflows, and webhooks

Everything your agent builds in Kody can run without the agent. That is the
difference between an automation and a chat transcript. Kody has four ways to
start work when nobody is typing, and every one of them runs a package you own —
no model in the loop, no tokens spent.

| You want to run…                                      | Use                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| The same thing on a schedule                          | a **job**              |
| One thing later, or something longer than a request   | a **workflow**         |
| Something when Sentry, GitHub, Stripe, or a CLI POSTs | an inbound **webhook** |
| Something when Kody itself emits an event             | a **subscription**     |

Prefer the event that actually describes the moment — a webhook or a
subscription — and reach for a schedule when no event exists. Cron is fine; it
is just not the hero.

## Jobs — recurring schedules that travel with the package

A job is declared in the package manifest, so the schedule ships with the
behavior it runs:

```json
{
	"kody": {
		"jobs": {
			"daily-digest": {
				"entry": "./src/daily-digest.ts",
				"schedule": { "type": "cron", "expression": "0 8 * * *" },
				"timezone": "America/Denver",
				"enabled": false
			}
		}
	}
}
```

- The entry is a package-local module with no arguments. The usual shape is a
  thin wrapper that calls a callable export and sends notify-self mail only when
  there is something to say.
- Publish with `"enabled": false`, invoke the wrapper once from `execute` to
  prove it, then enable. A schedule you have never run once is a schedule you
  will debug at 8 a.m.
- Each run gets a job-scoped scratch bucket; shared durable state (cursors, the
  last seen id) belongs in `packageStorage()`.
- `jobUpdate` adjusts schedule, timezone, enabled state, params, and
  `expires_at`; `jobRunNow` fires one run for debugging. Name and source stay in
  the repo — change them there and publish.

Jobs do not hang off an integration or an MCP connection. If a "job" has no
package, save the package first. Runs show up on `/account/jobs`.

## Workflows — deferred and durable one-shot work

A workflow is a durable run Kody executes later, outside the request that asked
for it. Use one instead of plain `execute` for:

- **later** — `runAt` in the future ("remind me Friday", "retry after the
  window")
- **longer** — batch sweeps, migrations, polling loops, or steps that would
  exceed execute's ~90 second budget; workflow steps get a longer sandbox
- **once** — an `idempotencyKey` makes a repeated `create` return the existing
  run instead of starting a duplicate

```ts
import { workflows } from 'kody:runtime'

export default async function main() {
	return await workflows.create({
		exportName: './rebuild-index',
		runAt: new Date(Date.now() + 15 * 60_000),
		idempotencyKey: 'rebuild-index:2026-09-08',
	})
}
```

`workflows.create` takes either `code` (a complete module string) or
`exportName` (a saved-package export). Inspect runs with `workflowRunList`,
cancel with `workflowRunCancel`; they appear on `/account/workflows`. Unnamed
inline runs display as `inline-code` with the idempotency key as a subtitle.
Recurring work is a job, not a workflow that reschedules itself.

## Inbound webhooks — the external HTTP knock

A webhook gives a package a credentialed ingress URL (the credential stays out
of MCP tool output). A provider POSTs to it and Kody dispatches the validated
request to the package export that owns it.

1. Declare it under `package.json#kody.webhooks`: a `name`, the `export` it
   binds to, and (for vendor senders) `verification` — HMAC header and encoding.
   Omit `secretName` for GitHub-style hooks so mint stores package-owned HMAC.
   Set `secretName` only for provider-issued secrets (Sentry, Stripe) and store
   that value with `secretSet`. Providers that quiz URL ownership (X CRC,
   WebSub, Meta, Slack) also declare `challenge`; the platform answers that quiz
   on the minted URL. One webhook name binds one export; there is no wildcard.
2. Mint a handle with `webhookUrlMint` (returns a `handle`, not the credential)
   and register it with `webhookUrlApply` (`type: "http"` with `{{webhookUrl}}`
   after the owner Approves the destination at `/connect/webhook-apply`; GitHub
   repo hooks use the same path against the Hooks API, with `{{webhookSecret}}`
   in `config.secret` when HMAC is declared). Treat the URL as a credential;
   tool output never includes it. When apply does not fit the provider, the
   owner copies the URL from the package's settings page
   (`/@<username>/<packageKodyId>/settings`, Webhooks section), where they can
   also reveal, rotate, disable, or enable it. Rotate keeps the previous URL
   live for 24 hours, or until the first accepted delivery arrives on the new
   URL. `/account/webhooks` lists every webhook across packages and links to
   those sections.

Declaring a webhook does not open ingress; minting does. Deliveries are
rate-limited per webhook (default 60 per minute, at most 600), and body-only
HMAC is replayable unless you opt into a timestamp window or delivery-id header.
Full contract and payload shapes: [Inbound webhooks](../use/webhooks.md).

Sentry noise, GitHub events, Stripe payments, a shortcut on your phone, a CLI on
your laptop — anything that can POST JSON can start a package this way.

## Subscriptions — events from inside Kody

When the trigger is something Kody already knows about — a message landing in
your inbox, a repo push, a run error, an integration losing auth — a package
subscribes to that topic in `package.json#kody.subscriptions` and Kody invokes
the handler with the event payload. After publish, smoke-test that handler from
interactive MCP with `packageSubscriptionDispatch`. Reuse another package with a
static `kody:@` import. Topics, payloads, and package-emitted events:
[Subscriptions and events](./package-subscriptions.md).

## The inbox is a trigger too

Every account has an email address. Mail that arrives there is stored and emits
`email.message.received`, so "forward it to Kody" is a valid trigger for people
and systems that can send email but cannot call an API. The same inbox is how a
job tells you it finished: `emailSend` mails the account's own address and
nothing else. See [Email primitives](../use/email-primitives.md).

## Choosing well

- A schedule is optional, not the point. If the person cannot name a time they
  want something to happen, leave the trigger off and let them ask.
- Test before you enable: import the wrapper from `execute`, smoke-test a
  subscription from interactive MCP with `packageSubscriptionDispatch`, or
  smoke-test a minted webhook with `webhookSyntheticDispatch` (not the same as a
  package-local `dryRun` field on trusted-client POSTs).
- Keep the wrapper quiet. Notify only when there is news; an empty digest every
  morning trains people to ignore the real one.
- Failures and recent runs for every trigger live on `/account/activity`.
