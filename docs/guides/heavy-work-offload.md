title: Offload work that does not fit a Worker isolate
summary:
  When package checks or publish rebuilds exceed isolate memory or CPU — usually
  a large npm graph such as PDF.js — keep the Kody package as a thin
  orchestrator and run the heavy work in a process the owner operates
  (Cloudflare Container, Fly machine, or similar). Do not provision paid infra
  without asking.

# Offload work that does not fit a Worker isolate

Kody packages run on Cloudflare Workers. Publish checks and artifact rebuilds
bundle every declared npm dependency inside a short-lived isolate. A dependency
graph that is fine in ad hoc `execute` can still fail those checks with an
isolate memory or CPU reset.

Kody does not host containers or long-running processes for a package. The owner
operates that process. The saved package stays a thin orchestrator:
authenticate, call the process, store results, notify. See
[No package services primitive](../contributing/decisions/0025-no-package-services-primitive.md).

Load this guide when:

- `repoRunChecks` or publish artifact rebuild reports that bundle validation
  exceeded the isolated runner's memory or CPU limits
- a Worker-compatible library is too large to bundle (PDF.js / `unpdf`, native
  addons, browsers, multi-minute CPU, large WASM)
- you are about to vendor or dynamically import the same graph to "get around"
  the check — that still bundles it

Do **not** use this guide for CJS/ESM helper interop (`tslib` /
`import_tslib.default`), missing exports, typecheck failures, or host-approval
errors. Those are different failures.

## The pattern

1. Keep the Kody package. It owns secrets, storage, jobs, and the callable
   surface.
2. Stop and show the owner a plan before creating paid compute. They create the
   process (Cloudflare Container, [Fly](https://fly.io) machine, or a box they
   already run). Do not open a cloud account or start a machine from `execute`.
3. The process exposes a narrow HTTPS API or MCP server. Prefer one job (extract
   text, render a page) over an unrestricted shell.
4. Save the base URL and a bearer token as secrets. Mount them on the package.
   Ask the owner to approve the fetch host.
5. The package `fetch`es that URL (or calls `kody.mcp["name"]` for an MCP
   server). It does not import the heavy library.

A home or LAN process uses the [home MCP guide](./local-mcp-tunnels.md) instead
of a public container.

## What stays in the package

- Input collection (email attachment, storage object, upload)
- Auth to the owner's process (mounted secret, host approval)
- `fetch` or MCP call with a hard timeout and a size cap
- Result write to `packageStorage()` or a follow-up notification
- Jobs and subscriptions that _trigger_ the work

```ts
export default async function extractInvoiceText(input: { objectKey: string }) {
	const response = await fetch('https://extractor.example.com/extract', {
		method: 'POST',
		headers: {
			authorization: 'Bearer {{secret:invoiceExtractorToken}}',
			'content-type': 'application/json',
		},
		body: JSON.stringify({ objectKey: input.objectKey }),
		signal: AbortSignal.timeout(30_000),
	})
	if (!response.ok) {
		throw new Error(`Extractor returned ${response.status}.`)
	}
	const contentLength = Number(response.headers.get('content-length'))
	if (Number.isFinite(contentLength) && contentLength > 200_000) {
		throw new Error('Extractor response exceeded 200 KB.')
	}
	const body = await response.text()
	if (new TextEncoder().encode(body).byteLength > 200_000) {
		throw new Error('Extractor response exceeded 200 KB.')
	}
	return JSON.parse(body) as { text: string }
}
```

Replace the example origin with the owner's process and approve that host before
calling it. Keep the bearer token in a saved secret.

## What does not stay in the package

- `unpdf`, `pdfjs-dist`, Playwright, native addons, or other graphs that blow
  the isolate
- "Make the import dynamic so checks skip it" — checks still bundle declared
  dependencies
- A Kody-owned container binding or package service

Ad hoc `execute` skips publish checks, so a large import can appear to work
there and still be unpublishable. Treat execute success as a prototype, not a
publish signal.

## Owner-operated runtimes

These are examples, not a Kody product surface. The owner picks one and pays it:

- **Cloudflare Containers** — a container next to Workers, called over HTTPS
- **Fly Machines** — a small always-on or scale-to-zero process
- **An existing box** — home NAS, VPS, or CI runner with a locked-down API

Write the extractor as a small HTTP service. Cap request body size and page
count. Return structured text, not a raw PDF.js handle.

## Secrets and approval

1. Create the URL and token secrets through `/connect/secret-set` (see
   [secret-backed integration](./secret-backed-integration.md)).
2. Declare them on the package (`kody.secretMounts` or `{{secret:name}}`).
3. Stop and send the owner the host-approval and package-approval links. Do not
   retry a blocked host.
4. Smoke-test the published export with a small fixture, not a 50 MB invoice.

## If the isolate-limit error is a surprise

The check message points here on purpose. Typical causes:

- A large npm dependency, even unused by some exports — every bundle target that
  imports it pays the cost
- Vendored `node_modules` or generated data files in the repo
- Twenty exports each inlining the same heavy graph

Fix: remove the heavy dependency from the package, move that work to the owner's
process, and keep the Kody side to the snippet above.
