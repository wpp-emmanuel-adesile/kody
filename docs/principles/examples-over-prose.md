# Examples over prose

Show one example that matches the current code. When a procedure has several
steps, make it a script or a Kody package. The page keeps three things: when it
applies, the command, and what failure looks like.

## Example

Local CLI execute has one guide and one skill. Other pages link them.

- When: Node ≥22 and `@kodycodes/cli` are available.
- Command: `npx @kodycodes/cli execute --local`
- Failure: `--local` cannot run. Use Open API / MCP `api`, or fix the
  environment.

`npm run docs:check-no-hosted-execute` rejects guidance that sends agents to the
hosted execute tool in that failure case.
