# Checks

Husky hooks, `npm run validate`, and the test commands that gate commits and
pushes. See the [setup index](./index.md) for the other setup pages.

- `git commit` runs the Husky `pre-commit` hook. It formats staged
  JavaScript/TypeScript/JSON/Markdown/CSS/YAML files (including
  `.github/workflows`) with `oxfmt` and applies `oxlint --fix` to staged
  JavaScript/TypeScript files. When the staged diff includes a path that is not
  docs-only, or when that diff cannot be listed, it also runs
  `npm run install:check`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run migrations:check`.
  A docs-only diff skips those three commands. `install:check` runs first so a
  snapshot whose `node_modules` lags `package-lock.json` fails with `run npm ci`
  instead of a typecheck that can look green from a stale remote cache.
  Docs-only means every path is under `docs/`, ends in `.md`, `.mdx`, or `.mdc`,
  or is a `LICENSE` / `LICENCE` / `COPYING` / `NOTICE` text file. A source file
  in the same commit, including a comment-only edit or a source file renamed to
  markdown, runs all three checks.
- `git push` runs the Husky `pre-push` hook. It executes `npm run test:push`
  (`CI=1` `test:node` + `test:workers`) when any updated ref changes a path that
  is not docs-only, or when the pushed paths cannot be listed. A docs-only range
  skips the suites. A push that changes `skills-lock.json` or any path under
  `.agents/skills/` also runs `npm run skills-lock:check`. `skills-lock.json`
  counts with docs for this hook: a push of only the lock, skill markdown, and
  other docs skips `test:push`. A non-markdown file under `.agents/skills/` (a
  script or a test) still runs `test:push`, as does any other source file. An
  unreadable push path list runs the skills-lock check too. Deleting a remote
  branch skips the suites and the skills-lock check. An update diffs the remote
  tip against the local tip, so a later docs-only push does not retest commits
  already on the remote. A new branch diffs against the merge base of
  `origin/HEAD`, `origin/main`, or `main` (never the branch being created).
  Those suites are the same Nx targets the CI Node / Workers jobs run, so a
  remote-cache hit is possible after a push that runs them. Bundled guides and
  other markdown are docs-only, so the local suites skip them.
  `npm run validate` and CI run those suites for every pull request. Playwright
  E2E stays in `npm run validate` and the CI E2E job. The push hook stops short
  of that suite because Playwright E2E is heavier than the unit gate, and a
  failed e2e leg skips the unit gate when the push is retried with
  `--no-verify`. Bundler artifacts live under
  `src/node_modules/.kody-generated/`. Local origin development uses Vite;
  `wrangler-env.ts` still wraps D1/types and sibling worker deploys. Playwright
  sets `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=test` so Vite skips platform/runtime auxiliary workers.
  Cursor Cloud Agent VMs keep Cursor's hook dispatcher as `core.hooksPath` and
  compose Husky through `npm run hooks:ensure` (`prepare` runs it after `husky`;
  Cloud Agent environment `start` should run it too) so `pre-push` still reaches
  `.husky/_` — see [cloud-agents.md](../cloud-agents.md#git-hooks). Vitest's
  default `testTimeout` is 20s so the workers pool's first Durable Object RPC in
  a file (~10s) does not fail the default budget (see
  [decision 0011](../decisions/0011-workers-unit-pool-harness.md)); the push
  gate also sets `CI=1` so worker count and Nx cache hashes match GitHub
  Actions. Full `npm run validate` sets `KODY_VALIDATE_LOAD=1` on the
  `test:workers` leg so `vitest.workers.config.ts` gives that suite a 40s
  timeout and `maxWorkers=2` under the parallel gate without changing production
  startup CPU budgets or node-unit timeouts (Cloud Agent load flakes: #2475,
  #2939; `tools/validate-load-contract.node.test.ts` locks the validate script
  shape).
- Because the commit hook already enforces formatting, lint fixes,
  install:check, and typechecking for commits that include code, agents do not
  need to run those checks separately before every code commit unless they want
  earlier feedback or are validating a larger change set before opening a PR.
  Docs-only commits format staged markdown. Typecheck, install:check, and the
  unit suites for those commits stay on `npm run validate` and CI.
- Push-time hooks intentionally stop short of `npm run validate`; Playwright
  E2E, MCP E2E, and repo-wide format checks remain explicit checks because they
  are heavier than the push gate.
- `npm run validate` is the single authoritative local gate. It is read-only.
  `prevalidate` runs `install:check` first so a snapshot whose `node_modules`
  lags `package-lock.json` fails with `run npm ci` instead of type/bundle
  errors. Then it executes `format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test:node`,
  `test:workers`, Playwright E2E, MCP E2E, `backup:build`, `status:build`,
  `nx-cache:build`, `jobs:build`, `highlight:build`, `api:build`,
  `api-docs:build`, `runtime:build`, `platform:build`,
  `worker-startup-bundles:check`, `primitives:check`, `migrations:check`,
  `deploy-guardrails:check`, `workflows:check`,
  `origin-production-exports:check`, `docs:check-temporal`,
  `docs:check-decisions`, `docs:check-no-hosted-execute`,
  `docs:check-file-refs`, `skills-lock:check`, `mermaid:check`,
  `slop-ratchet:check`, `knip`, `audit:prod`, `lockfile:check`, and
  `overrides:check` in parallel, reporting every failure (sibling checks are not
  aborted on the first failure, including when one of the docs or mermaid checks
  fails). `worker-startup-time:check` runs after that parallel phase so the CPU
  budget measures the bundle, not contention from e2e and Worker builds (#2475,
  #2759). The unit-test and Playwright legs set `CI=1` so timeouts, worker
  limits, and Nx cache hashes match the contended parallel layout used in GitHub
  Actions. CI runs the same checks as parallel jobs (🧹 Static, 🧪 Node, ☁️
  Workers, 🔌 MCP, 🎭 E2E, aggregated by ✅ Validate). If `npm run validate`
  passes locally, CI will pass. Trusted writers (Cloud Agent environments, and
  same-repo validate) set `NX_SELF_HOSTED_REMOTE_CACHE_SERVER` and the write
  token so Nx uploads task artifacts to `https://nx-cache.kody.codes`. Fork
  `pull_request` validate uses the read token and can only GET (see
  [decision 0019](../decisions/0019-self-hosted-nx-remote-cache.md),
  [decision 0038](../decisions/0038-no-nx-cloud-read-write-cache-tokens.md),
  [decision 0040](../decisions/0040-same-repo-writers-may-put-nx-cache.md), and
  [`packages/nx-cache/readme.md`](../../../packages/nx-cache/readme.md)). Those
  cached scripts run through `tools/run-nx.ts` so a mid-run remote-cache
  transport flake cannot fail validate after the tasks already succeeded.
- `npm run install:check` (`tools/check-installed-lockfile.ts`, also
  `control-kody doctor`'s `deps` check) fails when a root or workspace
  dependency's installed version does not match `package-lock.json`, including
  nested workspace installs (for example `packages/worker/node_modules/satori`).
  Cloud Agent snapshots can lag a lockfile bump after `git pull`; this is the
  `run npm ci` hint.
- `npm run lockfile:check` fails when a locked direct dependency sits inside its
  declared range but outside a peer range that range can still reach.
  `npm install` rewrites `package-lock.json` for that drift (including an
  optional peer). The check keeps a Cloud Agent environment install from leaving
  a dirty lockfile on a fresh checkout.
- `npm run skills-lock:check` (`tools/check-skills-lock.ts`) fails when
  `skills-lock.json` drifts from the committed skill folders it records.
  `ship-pr` must stay a repo-owned local skill (so `skills update` does not
  reinstall it from kentcdodds/kcd-skills) and its `computedHash` must match the
  folder hash. Edit the skill and refresh `computedHash`, or the check fails.
- `npm run docs:check-file-refs` (`tools/check-markdown-file-refs.ts`) fails
  when markdown cites a repo file that is not in the tree. Inline code paths
  under `packages/`, `docs/`, `tools/`, `e2e/`, `.agents/`, or `.github/` are
  checked when their parent directory exists, and relative links are checked
  always. Generated Wrangler configs (`wrangler-*.generated.json` and anything
  under `.wrangler/`) and local `.env` files are ignored. A path the same line
  names as absent is ignored. Example trees whose parent directory is not in the
  repo are ignored.
- `npm run overrides:check` fails when a root `package.json` override is not
  documented in [dependency overrides](../dependency-overrides.md), when that
  doc keeps a section for a removed override, or when `package.json` repeats a
  key (JSON keeps only the last value).
- `npm run deploy-guardrails:check` protects reviewed Durable Object migration
  history and bindings in both Wrangler configs, requires exact allowlisting for
  class deletion, and rejects destructive Cloudflare CLI operations in
  automatically triggered GitHub Actions jobs.
- `npm run workflows:check` (`tools/check-workflow-refs.ts`) rejects
  `steps.<id>.outputs` and `needs.<id>` references in `.github/workflows/*.yml`
  that do not name an existing step or job id. GitHub resolves those
  misspellings to empty strings instead of failing the run, so a typo in
  `deploy.yml` would otherwise first appear on a production deploy.
- `npm run validate:fix` runs `format` + `lint:fix` and is the explicit opt-in
  for mutating auto-fixes. It is never required to pass `validate`.
- `npm run format` applies formatting updates on its own.
- `npm run test:push` runs the same `test:node` and `test:workers` suites
  enforced by the Husky `pre-push` hook and by the CI Node / Workers jobs.
- `npm run test:e2e:run` ensures Playwright Chromium is installed before the
  suite starts, so `npm run validate` self-heals on a fresh machine.
- Use `npm run test:e2e:install` when you want to prefetch Playwright browsers
  ahead of time instead of waiting for the first E2E run. On Cloud Agent Linux,
  `test:e2e:ensure` (the same script `test:e2e:install` runs) uses native
  `unzip` because `playwright install` hangs on that kernel. Other machines
  still run `playwright install` (`--with-deps` is local-only). CI caches
  `~/.cache/ms-playwright` and runs `test:e2e:ensure`, so a lockfile-matching
  cache hit skips the download and never runs `apt-get` (`apt-get update` can
  hang the E2E job past the 15-minute timeout).
- `npm run test:e2e:run` runs the Playwright suite through Nx and depends on a
  cached `worker:prepare-e2e-env` target for `.env` bootstrap plus an uncached
  `worker:prepare-playwright` target that checks the local Chromium install.
- `npm run test:mcp` runs MCP server E2E tests and also depends on the cached
  `worker:prepare-e2e-env` target, which writes `packages/worker/.env` from
  `.env.example` when needed and backfills `COOKIE_SECRET` before the test run.
