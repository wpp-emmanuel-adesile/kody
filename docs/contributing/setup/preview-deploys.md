# PR preview deployments

The GitHub Actions preview workflow creates per-preview Cloudflare resources so
each PR preview is isolated. See the [setup index](./index.md) for the other
setup pages.

- App worker: `<preview-worker-name>` (for kody: `kody-pr-<n>`). Generated
  preview config sets `workers_dev: true` so secret-bulk reapply cannot drop the
  `<name>.<subdomain>.workers.dev` trigger (Cloudflare error 1042).
- Platform worker: `<preview-worker-name>-platform`
- Runtime worker: `<preview-worker-name>-runtime`
- Jobs worker: `<preview-worker-name>-jobs`
- Highlight worker: `<preview-worker-name>-highlight`
- App D1 database: `<preview-worker-name>-db`
- Audit D1 database: `<preview-worker-name>-audit-db`
- Jobs D1 database: shared `kody-preview-jobs` (ensured by
  `jobs-worker-resources.ts`; not per-PR)
- KV namespace (OAuth state): `<preview-worker-name>-oauth-kv`
- KV namespace (published source snapshots / bundles):
  `<preview-worker-name>-bundle-artifacts-kv`
- Cloudflare Artifacts namespace: `<preview-worker-name>` (same as the app
  worker name, for example `kody-pr-<n>`). Package create/publish/overwrite and
  git remotes use this namespace via the `ARTIFACTS` binding and
  `ARTIFACTS_NAMESPACE` var — not the shared committed `preview` namespace.
- Mock workers: `<preview-worker-name>-mock-<service>`

When a PR is closed, the cleanup job deletes the preview
app/platform/runtime/jobs Workers, mock Workers, Queues, per-preview D1/KV/R2,
the per-PR Artifacts namespace (repos emptied, then namespace deleted when the
API allows), and these per-PR resources. It does not delete shared names such as
`kody-preview-jobs`, the shared Artifacts namespaces `production` / `preview`,
or any production name.

Cleanup is bounded, retry-safe, and idempotent. Transient Cloudflare 429 and 5xx
responses (including wrangler 504 Gateway Timeout) retry with backoff inside the
four-minute job budget. Permanent 401/403 failures are not retried. A failure on
one resource does not skip later independent resources: the sweep finishes, then
fails once with every leftover name. Already-missing resources count as success.
Queue consumers are removed before Workers, and Workers before Queues, because
those deletes depend on each other. Non-empty preview R2 buckets are emptied
(objects deleted) before the bucket delete; leftover objects surface in the same
aggregate failure instead of a warning.

Cloudflare Workers supports version `preview_urls`, but those preview URLs are
not available for Workers that use Durable Objects. The main app Worker binds
`MCP_OBJECT`, so app previews use per-PR Worker names. Mock Workers do not use
Durable Objects, so their Wrangler configs opt into `preview_urls = true` and
the workflow includes mock version preview links when Cloudflare returns them.

Production deploys also ensure required Cloudflare resources exist before
migrations/deploy:

- D1 database: from `env.production.d1_databases` binding `APP_DB`
- KV namespace: `OAUTH_KV` (defaults to `<worker-name>-oauth` when creating)

Both the preview and production deploy workflows run post-deploy healthchecks
and fail the job if any expected worker is missing the deployed commit:

- origin: `<deploy-url>/health` →
  `{ ok: true, commitSha, commit, pullRequest, deploy }` (`commitSha` is the
  version pin; browsers that prefer HTML get clickable commit/PR/job links)
- platform: `/__platform/health` → `{ status: "ok", commitSha }`
- runtime: `/__runtime/health` → `{ status: "ok", commitSha }`
- jobs: `/health` on the jobs workers.dev URL → `{ ok: true, commit }` (jobs has
  no public hostname; the workflow uses the deploy output URL)

Preview deploys also run `node tools/seed-test-data.ts --remote` after deploy,
seeding `me@kentcdodds.com` / `ilikecode` (a non-admin account; the `jane`
companion account is only seeded locally). See `.github/workflows/preview.yml`
for the exact invocation.

Preview cleanup also deletes the matching GitHub environment
(`preview-<pr-number>`). That API requires repository administration write
access, so the repo must define a `PREVIEW_ENVIRONMENT_ADMIN_TOKEN` Actions
secret with a token that has that permission. Cleanup intentionally fails when
that secret is missing or under-scoped so permission regressions are visible.

Every Cloudflare delete in `tools/ci/preview-resources.ts` (Workers, D1, KV, R2,
Queues and their consumers, Artifacts namespaces) first passes through
`assertPreviewResourceName(name, kind)`, which throws unless the name matches
`^kody-(pr-<number>|branch-<slug>)(-<segment>)*$`. Production names (`kody`,
`kody-platform`, `kody-audit`, `kody-webhook-dispatch`, ...), shared Artifacts
namespaces (`production`, `preview`), and the shared `kody-preview*` names never
match, so a bug or an empty PR number cannot compute a production name and
delete it. `npm run deploy-guardrails:check` fails if a destructive call in that
script is not preceded by the guard in the same function.

The production deploy workflow can also be started manually from GitHub Actions
via **Run workflow** on `main`. The manual path verifies that the selected
commit is the current `origin/main` HEAD before it deploys, and force-deploys
every worker (including optional ones the 15-commit path-filter lookback can
skip after a long Validate gap). See [rollback](../rollback.md).

If you ever need to do the same operations manually, use:

- `node tools/ci/preview-resources.ts ensure --worker-name <name> --out-config <path>`
- `node tools/ci/preview-resources.ts cleanup --worker-name <name>`
- `node tools/ci/preview-resources.ts reset-d1 --worker-name <name>` (per-PR
  app + audit D1 only; see migration renumber race below)
- `node tools/ci/production-resources.ts ensure --out-config <path>`

### Migration renumber race on an existing preview D1

When a long-lived PR preview already applied migration `NNNN-foo.sql`, then
`main` lands another `NNNN-…` and the branch renumbers to `NNNN+1-foo.sql`,
Wrangler would otherwise re-apply the same SQL under the new name and fail (for
example `duplicate column name`). Before each preview `d1 migrations apply`, the
workflow runs `tools/ci/rewrite-renamed-preview-migrations.ts` (requires
`CLOUDFLARE_ENV=preview`). It rewrites `d1_migrations` rows whose filename is
gone but whose SQL sha256 still matches a current file on the branch (historical
SQL is recovered from git via `commit^:path` when the last touch renamed the
file; the preview deploy job checks out with `fetch-depth: 0`). It does **not**
guess from the kebab slug alone — that would skip applying revised SQL after a
rebase that also changed the migration. The script also refuses any wrangler
config whose binding `database_name` is not a preview name (`kody-pr-*` /
`kody-branch-*` or shared `kody-preview-jobs`). That is bookkeeping only — not a
schema drop — and never runs in production.

If rewrite cannot match (content changed as well as the name, or git cannot
recover the old file), use the **reset preview D1** fallback for **PR** preview
databases only (`kody-pr-<n>-db` and `kody-pr-<n>-audit-db`). This deletes
preview seed data for that PR; the next Deploy Preview Resources run recreates
the D1s, applies migrations fresh, and reseeds. It is not a production
data-drop. Names still pass through `assertPreviewResourceName`, and `reset-d1`
refuses `kody-branch-*` worker names.

```bash
# Requires CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (+ CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID for list/delete).
# Worker name must be exactly kody-pr-<n>.
node tools/ci/preview-resources.ts reset-d1 --worker-name kody-pr-<n>
```

Then re-run the preview workflow (or `preview-resources.ts ensure` followed by
migrations apply and `tools/seed-test-data.ts --remote`). Do **not** delete the
shared jobs preview database (`kody-preview-jobs`) this way — that name is
shared across previews; prefer the sha-match rewrite, or ask before resetting
it.

To **manually test** a PR preview (find the URL, sign in as the seeded user,
create specific data with `--request`, assert the change), see
[Manual preview testing](../preview-manual-testing.md) and run
`npm run preview:manual-test`.
