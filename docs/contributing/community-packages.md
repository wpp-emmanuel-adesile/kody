# Public packages

**Public / private** is repo visibility. **Community** is the catalog place
(`/community`, MCP `community` domain), not a package kind. A listing is the
catalog row. See [0046](./decisions/0046-community-is-the-catalog.md).

Community listings let users on the same deployment share **pinned snapshots**
of published saved packages. Listings are public read; forks stay **inert**
until the forker publishes through a repo session. See
[Public packages (usage)](../use/community-packages.md) for agent-facing
workflows.

## Architecture overview

```

        │
        ▼
D1 saved_packages.is_private = 0 + community_listings row
        │              KV source snapshot keyed by SHA
        ▼
Public /community + /@username/:name + /tree/:ref + /settings
        │
        │   also: /@username/:name.git  (read-only smart HTTP → Artifacts)
        ▼
Visitor forks ──► communityFork ──► entity_sources (no saved_packages row)
        │                              copy of HEAD, inert until publish
        ▼
repoOpenSession → review → fix imports → repoPublishSession
        │                              (optional absorbed_upstream_commit)
        ▼
Live saved package in forker's account
```

Community search and capabilities live in the **`community`** MCP domain. They
are intentionally **not** merged into the general MCP `search` tool or saved
package vector indexes.

## Storage

### D1 tables

The squashed baseline (`packages/worker/migrations/0001-squashed-init.sql`)
defines the community tables and profile columns.

| Table                | Purpose                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `community_listings` | Listing metadata, pinned commit, optional `package_version` (`package.json#version`), browse `category`, status (`active` / `delisted`) |
| `community_forks`    | Fork records linking listing, forker, and inert `source_id`                                                                             |
| `community_ratings`  | Per-user ratings (upsert on `listing_id` + `user_id`)                                                                                   |
| `community_reports`  | Reports with denormalized `listing_name` / `listing_owner_user_id`                                                                      |
| `community_bans`     | Community-wide bans (publish, fork, rate, report)                                                                                       |

| Table / column                    | Purpose                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `users.display_name`, `users.bio` | Optional public profile fields                                                   |
| `users.profile_visibility`        | `public` (default) or `private`                                                  |
| `saved_packages.is_private`       | Repo visibility (`0` public / catalog, `1` private). Not `package.json#private`. |
| `user_repos.is_private`           | Same visibility flag on plain repos (default private).                           |
| `community_activity_events`       | Stored `listing_published` / `listing_updated` events only                       |

Activity actor columns store the MCP **stable user id**
(`users.stable_user_id`), matching other community ownership columns such as
`community_listings.owner_user_id`.

`saved_packages.is_private` defaults to `1`. Visibility is a repo setting
(`packageUpdate` / `repoUpdate`), not a `package.json#private` projection.
Active community listings backfill to public; leftover `"private": false`
teasers stay private.

### Public `.git` smart HTTP

`/@owner/kody-id.git` is a **read-only** Git smart HTTP proxy for active public
listings (`packages/worker/src/repo/public-package-git-http.ts`). The origin
Worker handles it before the anonymous HTML edge cache and Remix. Flow:

1. Resolve the listing via `resolveCommunityPackageUrl` (404 when missing /
   private / delisted — same non-leak posture as package pages).
2. Load `entity_sources` + mint an Artifacts **read** token server-side.
3. Advertise only the immutable published snapshot commit (`published_commit`,
   else listing `pinned_commit`) on `HEAD` / `refs/heads/<defaultBranch>`.
4. Proxy `git-upload-pack` to Artifacts with `Authorization: Bearer …`. Strip
   `Location` / `WWW-Authenticate` / `Set-Cookie` so the Artifacts host and
   credentials never reach the client.
5. Reject `git-receive-pack` and `?service=git-receive-pack` with 403.

Owner authoring remotes remain `packageGetGitRemote` (signed-in). See
[Public packages (usage)](../use/community-packages.md#clone-a-public-package-read-only-git).

Profile activity reads stored `community_activity_events` plus public forks from
`community_forks`. Forks appear only while the forker's saved package copy has
`is_private = 0`. Ratings are never projected into profile activity.

`community_forks.origin_commit` is the origin SHA the fork last absorbed. It
starts as HEAD copied at fork time. When that SHA and the listing pin differ,
the platform walks the **listing origin** Artifacts repo from the absorb marker.
The fork is a new repo and does not contain origin SHAs. `listing_ahead`
/`listingAhead` are true only when the listing pin is **not** an ancestor of
that absorb marker (behind or diverged). If the pin is an ancestor — or ancestry
cannot be proven — the relation is **ahead**: catalog cards, the owner profile,
and listing detail show a **Fork ahead** badge linking to the listing files at
the pin, and MCP search / `packageGet` / `packageList` omit any ahead flag or
next step. When the fork is behind, catalog cards and the owner profile show a
yellow **Fork outdated** copy-prompt control (linked to that listing tree);
listing detail uses a link-break icon for the same action. Clearing an outdated
banner is done by publishing with `repoPublishSession` and
`absorbed_upstream_commit`; that does not copy files.

`community_listings` enforces one listing per `(owner_user_id, package_id)`.
Admin **delist** sets `status = 'delisted'`, blocks owner re-publish, and blocks
owner unpublish. **Hard delete** (admin report action) removes the listing row,
KV snapshot, and ratings.

There is no trusted-listing mark. Public listing records expose
`trusted: false`. `POST /community/:listingId/trust.json` returns 410.

Admin **featured** marks live in `featured_at`. Featured is editorial placement
on `/community` and listing detail (`featured_at IS NOT NULL`), not a safety
badge and not a wizard step. Operators publish official starters under a
platform scope (for example `@kody`) by passing `package_scope` while holding a
package scope grant; see
[Platform accounts](./architecture/platform-accounts.md). Surfaces: the
`Featured` badge on the detail page, the admin-only toggle
(`POST /community/:listingId/feature.json`, audited), and the admin-only
`communitySetFeatured` capability. `communityGet` exposes the `featured` flag.

`listFeaturedCommunityListings` also loads up to 12 slim
`OnboardingFeaturedListing` shapes into the signed-in onboarding payload so
persist-prompt copy can name an already-installed example. The `/onboarding`
wizard itself is connect an agent, make something useful (one prompt), then
connect a second agent — see [Onboarding process](./architecture/onboarding.md).
Official `@kody/*` listings are catalog and fork source — person accounts run
the owned copy, not the platform package. One-click install on listing detail
puts a fork icon beside the name for official `@kody/*` packages. Listings from
another account use the same fork icon and `createDoubleCheck` (the tooltip is
“This was built by another user. Verify it before using. Click again to confirm
fork.”; the first click arms that control; the second click sends
`acknowledged: true`; clicking elsewhere, navigating, or leaving the control
clears the armed state; the endpoint responds `409` without the flag).
User-facing install UX:
[Public packages](../use/community-packages.md#one-click-install). `/community`
cards overlay a per-request `viewerInstall` when the viewer already has a
matching slug saved package or a `community_forks` row, so those cards show
**Installed** / **Forked** / **Fork outdated** / **Fork ahead**. Listing detail
uses title-slot icons for install, an open icon for a current fork, a link-break
icon for an outdated fork, a clipboard when a setup prompt exists, and a **Fork
ahead** badge when the pin is already in the fork history. An installed fork
offers **Use in agent** under the listing.

Reports survive listing deletion via denormalized listing name and owner on the
report row.

### KV snapshots

Pinned file trees live in `BUNDLE_ARTIFACTS_KV` under:

`community-snapshot:v1:{listingId}`

`packages/worker/src/community/snapshot.ts` reads and writes `CommunitySnapshot`
(`version`, `listingId`, `pinnedCommit`, `files`, optional `communityIconPath`,
`createdAt`). Publish and re-publish overwrite the snapshot; unpublish and hard
delete remove it. Raster list-mark bytes (`.kody/icon.*`, root `icon.*`, and
`community-icon.*`) are omitted from the text-backed `files` map; the path
metadata lets the icon route retrieve bytes from Artifacts. Package-app
`icons/icon-192.png` stays in the snapshot so forks keep their PWA icon. The
public `/@owner/kody-id/tree/:ref` explorer reads this snapshot (not a live git
checkout). Leftover `/files` URLs 301 to `/tree/{defaultBranch}`.

### Community icon cache

Community listing icons are derived lazily from the listing's **icon commit**:
the owner package's current `entity_sources.published_commit` (falling back to
the listing's pinned commit when the source row is gone). Listing reads join the
entity source, so a plain package publish moves the icon commit forward — and
with it the icon URL — without a community republish. `@epic-web/cachified`
stores a small descriptor in `BUNDLE_ARTIFACTS_KV` under
`derived-cache:v1:community-icon:v3:{listingId}:{commit}`. The processed bytes
live in the private `COMMUNITY_ASSETS` R2 bucket under
`community-icon:v3/{listingId}/{commit}/asset`.

On a descriptor cache miss, the icon service resolves the identity-mark path
(from the pinned snapshot when serving the pinned commit, otherwise by probing
the Artifacts git repo at the icon commit), reads the bytes, validates them, and
writes the derived asset to R2 before returning the descriptor. The taught file
is `.kody/icon.png` (also `.svg`, `.webp`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`). Root `icon.*` and
`community-icon.*` are permanent aliases; package apps can also use
`icons/icon-192.png`. A dangling descriptor is deleted and regenerated once.
Packages without an icon receive a generated fallback: a deterministic swirl
from the package name
(`packages/worker/src/community/community-icon-fallback.ts`). Every accepted
source (SVG rasterized first, then PNG, WebP, and JPEG) is fitted through the
Cloudflare Images binding to a 256-pixel WebP (`fit: scale-down`, quality 90).
Publish and account-deletion cleanup also remove leftover `community-icon:v1`
and `community-icon:v2` keys.

Repo- and package-scoped list marks (including unpublished packages and plain
repos) use the same path contract and ingest fit, stored under
`identity-icon:v1/{repoId}/{commit}/asset` and
`derived-cache:v1:identity-icon:v1:{repoId}:{commit}`. Package URLs are
`/@:username/:kodyId/icon/:iconCommit`. Owner-only repo URLs are
`/account/repos/:repoId/icon/:iconCommit`. Publish and default-branch push prune
superseded identity-icon revisions. List UIs (`/@username`, `/community`,
community detail) render `IdentityIconMark`; `repoList` returns `icon_url`.

The icon route serves only the current icon commit and the pinned commit; stale
commit URLs 404. Package publish (`finalizePublishedEntitySource`) calls
`refreshIdentityIconForSource` (repo-keyed list mark) and
`refreshCommunityIconForPackagePublish` (listing-scoped catalog mark). The
community hook prunes superseded KV/R2 icon entries by listing prefix and
invalidates the public listing data cache. Community republish, unpublish, admin
hard delete, and account deletion remove icon entries for the listing. Account
deletion also prefix-deletes `identity-icon:v1/{repoId}/` for every owned
source.

`publishCommunityListing` has no MIT, logo, Intent, or personal-content gates.
Visibility is separate from package publish checks, which require non-empty root
`README.md` and `AGENTS.md` before a new version can publish. Agents follow a
hygiene pass in `package_authoring` before flipping public; the Worker does not
scan or block on that review. It requires a published commit and that the owner
is not community-banned. It upserts D1 metadata including optional browse
`category` from `package.json#kody.category` or well-known tags, and writes a
SHA-keyed source snapshot.

`forkCommunityListing` reads the KV snapshot for rewrite/scan (Worker), then
copies the origin Artifacts repo with `POST .../repos/{source}/fork` so the tree
never enters a RepoSession isolate as `Record<path, string>` edits. When the
caller omits an explicit leaf and the listing leaf is already taken by an
unrelated saved package (no `community_forks` row for this listing at that
leaf), it picks the next free `leaf-N` (`allocate-fork-leaf.ts`). An explicit
leaf errors if that name is taken. A repeat fork of the same listing errors with
the existing fork instead of allocating another leaf. Persist stamps dest
`published_commit` to dest HEAD (the default-branch tip the fork copied) and
records that SHA on `community_forks.origin_commit`. When dest HEAD matches the
listing pin used in prepare, only rewritten files (`package.json` and
self-reference text) are applied. When dest HEAD is ahead of that pin, persist
re-derives the `package.json` rewrite from dest HEAD instead of applying
pin-relative edits that would revert later origin commits. When the origin
Artifacts repo is missing, persist falls back to the full-tree snapshot sync.
Isolate memory / Artifacts `MEMORY_LIMIT` failures surface as
`CommunityForkResourceLimitError` (honest UI/MCP copy; fork count does not
increment). Records `community_forks` — **without** inserting `saved_packages`.
Failed persist cleanup deletes the dest Artifacts repo, the inert entity source,
any slug redirects for the allocated package id, and the matching
`community_forks` row so a leftover metadata row cannot inflate `fork_count` or
block a retry.

`communityFork` returns request-scoped `serverTiming` entries
(`{ name, durationMs }`), the same shape as `execute`. They are not written to
D1 or Analytics Engine. The storage-layer path records `artifacts-fork`. The
full-tree fallback may include nested `bootstrap-*` phases from the RepoSession
Durable Object; `bootstrap-source` is the RPC wall clock, including isolate
startup. Subtract the nested bootstrap phases from `bootstrap-source` to
estimate cold start. `Date.now()` in Workers only advances across I/O, so
CPU-only steps may report `0`.

`rateCommunityListing` requires a prior fork row for the rater and rejects
ratings from the listing owner. `reportCommunityListing` stores denormalized
listing metadata for the admin queue.

`listCommunityActivityForAdmin` exposes a role-gated metadata projection over
forks and ratings. Rows contain public listing identity, acting username,
timestamp, and rating scores; they omit rating notes, forked source/package ids,
stable user ids, and package source. Rating rows use `updated_at`, so the feed
shows the latest value for each user/listing rating. Since one-click install and
agent fork both persist through `community_forks`, historical data cannot
distinguish them and reports both as `fork`. Fork writes snapshot the public
listing name and package name leaf, preserving readable fork provenance after a
later hard delete. Rows without recoverable listing identity use explicit
deleted/unknown placeholders. Actor usernames resolve through the unique
`users.stable_user_id` index; neither email nor stable user id enters the feed
or event.

`installCommunityListing` (one-click install) composes `forkCommunityListing`
with `runRepoChecks` over the fork's rewritten snapshot files and, when checks
pass, `refreshSavedPackageProjection` — the same projection step
`repoPublishSession` ends with, so declared jobs are scheduled immediately. When
checks fail (typically cross-scope imports), the fork stays inert and the
failing checks are returned for agent follow-up. The HTTP surface is
`POST /community/:listingId/install.json` (authenticated). Official `@kody/*`
listings skip acknowledgement. Third-party listings must send
`acknowledged: true` or the handler responds `409`. There is intentionally
**no** MCP capability for install: agents must go through `communityFork` +
repo-session review, so a prompt-injected agent cannot silently activate
community code.

## MCP capabilities

Domain module: `packages/worker/src/mcp/capabilities/community/`

Capabilities:

- `communityPublish`
- `communityUnpublish`
- `communitySearch`
- `communityGet`
- `communityFork`
- `communityForkAdopt` (read-only: returns the website adoption link; only the
  signed-in account session adopts via `POST /account/packages.json`)
- `communityRate`
- `communityProfileGet` / `communityProfileUpdate`
- `communityReport`
- `communitySetFeatured` (admin-only via `requiredRole`)

The admin domain also exposes `adminCommunityActivityList`, guarded by
`requiredRole: 'admin'`, for the narrow operator activity feed, and
`adminCommunityOrphanForksCleanup` for leftover `community_forks` rows whose
inert entity source and saved package are both gone. Healthy community forks
stay inert (no `saved_packages` row) and keep an `entity_sources` row, so a
missing package alone is not an orphan. `apply` defaults to false (preview);
optional `fork_ids` still skip any row that still has a source or package.

Register the domain in `builtinDomains` and `capabilityDomainNames` like other
builtin domains (see [Adding capabilities](./adding-capabilities.md)). Do not
surface community listings through the general capability/package search path.

## Public routes and Open Graph images

App handlers: `packages/worker/src/app/handlers/community*` (index, detail,
og:image).

Client routes: `packages/worker/client/routes/community*`

- `/community` — searchable index of active listings, grouped by category on the
  unfiltered browse page (`?category=` filters to one category). Empty
  categories omit their chip; an empty catalog hides the facet and sort row.
- `/@:username/:kodyId` — the canonical package page, resolved from the owner
  plus the package slug (the saved package by name leaf, then its listing by
  `package_id`; JSON companion: `/profiles/:username/packages/:kodyId.json`).
  The listing slug stays the public pair until republish. `username_redirects`
  and `package_slug_redirects` map prior owner usernames and package slugs to a
  redirect at that URL
- `/@:username/:kodyId/tree/:ref(/*relativePath)` — GitHub-lite source explorer
  (default-branch name from git, SHA, or another branch). `HEAD` and leftover
  `/files` URLs 301 to `/tree/{defaultBranch}` (`main` when lookup misses).
  Allowlisted images, video, and audio preview in the blob pane via a
  same-origin `/raw/` route (`<img>` / `<video>` / `<audio>`). SVG is served
  only as `image/svg+xml` for `<img src>` — markup is never injected. Other
  binaries show a non-preview message instead of a latin1 code dump.
- `/@:username/:kodyId/raw/:ref(/*relativePath)` — allowlisted media bytes for
  that preview (same authz and tree resolution as the explorer). A hex ref that
  only falls back to the listing pin snapshot 404s, same as the tree.
  Listing-uuid fallback: `/community/:listingId/raw(/*relativePath)`.
  `Content-Type` comes from the extension allowlist plus a magic-byte sniff;
  responses are `nosniff` + `Content-Disposition: inline` and never `text/html`
  or JavaScript.
- `/community/:listingId` — the same page by listing id; redirects to the
  canonical URL. Metadata, ratings, README, one-click install (login required;
  other-account listings arm via `createDoubleCheck` and fork on the second
  click; official `@kody/*` install on first click), fork prompt, and report
  link (report requires login)
- `/community/:listingId/icon/:iconCommit` — cached package icon or generated
  fallback; serves the current icon commit or the pinned snapshot commit, and
  rejects stale commit URLs

Shared OG rendering lives in `packages/worker/src/og/`: a light-mode palette
mirroring app design tokens, satori layout + resvg rasterization, Twemoji images
for emoji graphemes (`loadAdditionalAsset` — the Latin OG fonts have no color
emoji), and the `publicOgPages` registry. Static public pages serve generated
images from `/og/:page.png` (page ids such as `home`, `community`, `login`).
Community listing cards use `og-image.ts` on that same pipeline and are served
at `/community/:listingId/og.png` (package identity as the visual hero —
community icon, package name, and byline — with a truncated muted description as
supporting text, then star rating and fork count).

## Admin moderation

Handler: `packages/worker/src/app/handlers/admin-community-reports*`

Route: `/admin/community-reports` (admin role)

Queue shows reporter, reason, and listing metadata. Actions use double-confirm:

| Action                      | Effect                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dismiss                     | Close report, listing unchanged                                  |
| Delist                      | `status = delisted`, blocks owner re-publish and unpublish       |
| Hard delete                 | Remove listing, KV snapshot, and ratings                         |
| Ban reporter / ban reportee | `community_bans` row; user cannot publish, fork, rate, or report |

`resolveCommunityReport` in `service.ts` implements dismiss, delist, and delete.
`banCommunityUser` / `unbanCommunityUser` manage community-wide bans.

Successful fork and rating writes enqueue `{ eventId, kind, activityId }` for
durable `community.activity.recorded` delivery. The Queue consumer reloads the
same metadata-only projection and uses the shared admin package-subscription
fan-out, which resolves admin package owners fresh for every attempt. The event
therefore reaches only admin-owned subscribed packages and is suitable for
operator notifications such as Discord.

The first successful listing publish enqueues `{ eventId, listingId }` for
durable `community.listing.published` delivery (same admin fan-out as activity
events). Republishes write `listing_updated` for profile activity but do not
enqueue this topic. Enqueue failures are logged and never fail
`communityPublish`. See
[the admin events guide](../guides/admin-events.md#communitylistingpublished-admins)
for the handler payload.

A republish whose pinned commit differs from the stored listing enqueues a
`{ kind: 'fork_upstream_updated', eventId, listingId, previous, current, publishedAt }`
message on the same queue. `previous` and `current` are
`{ pinnedCommit, packageVersion }`. Change detection lives in
`publishCommunityListing` (`hasCommunityListingReleaseChanged`); the consumer is
`dispatchCommunityForkUpstreamUpdatedSubscriptionEvents`. It lists every
`community_forks` row for the listing, skips forks already at the new pin, and
invokes `community.fork.upstream_updated` on each forker's own subscribed
packages, one event per fork. Forking is required: there is no listing watch.
Payload:
[Package subscriptions](../guides/package-subscriptions.md#communityforkupstream_updated).

## Inert fork mechanism

Forks create an **`entity_sources`** row and Artifacts snapshot but **no**
`saved_packages` row. Without a saved package row:

- package exports, jobs, subscriptions, and apps do not register
- `kody:@…` imports from the fork do not execute
- search and execute cannot treat the fork as a live saved package

Activation happens through two paths: the forker runs `repoPublishSession`, or a
one-click `installCommunityListing` whose publish checks pass — both end in the
same saved-package projection. Repo checks reject publishes that still contain
cross-scope static imports or foreign `kody.dependencies` entries
(`fork-scan.ts` surfaces these at fork time).

## Search ranking

`searchCommunityListings` ranks **active** listings only:

1. Build a search document from name, package name leaf, description, tags,
   search text, and a README snippet. Category filters apply after scoring.
2. Score with the same lexical + deterministic-embedding blend used for
   capability search (`blendLexicalAndVectorScore`, `deterministicEmbedding`).
3. Multiply by a **Bayesian average** of star ratings:

   prior mean **3.25**, prior weight **5**

   `(5 × 3.25 + count × averageStars) / (5 + count)`

Empty queries sort by Bayesian score, then `publishedAt`. Pass `sort: "newest"`
(or `/community?sort=newest`) to order matching listings by `publishedAt`
descending instead. `published_at` is last community publish time: republishing
overwrites it. Pass `category` (or `/community?category=integrations`) to keep
only that browse category. Unfiltered `/community` browse groups the newest
candidates by category and shows a few cards in each section.

Fork counts are live `COUNT(*)` aggregates over `community_forks` grouped by
listing id. Detail reads always count the selected listing. Browse and search
counts are also correct for every materialized result, although unfiltered
browse intentionally ranks only the newest 500 candidates. The reported
production mismatch for `@kentcdodds/github` was therefore consistent with a
data snapshot/cache artifact rather than a defect in the aggregate SQL; the
worker integration test pins that a successful fork increments the surfaced
count. Failed fork cleanup and `packageDelete` of the forked copy remove the
matching `community_forks` row (application delete plus D1 `AFTER DELETE`
triggers on `saved_packages` and `entity_sources` in
`0061-community-forks-package-delete-cascade.sql`), so the live count drops
without a separate recount and the viewer overlay cannot keep showing **Fork
outdated** for a package that is gone. Healthy inert forks keep their
`entity_sources` row and are not dropped. `adminCommunityOrphanForksCleanup`
remains a backstop for leftover rows whose source and saved package are both
already gone.

`computeCommunityBayesianScore` in `service.ts` implements the prior so a few
5-star ratings do not beat many good ratings.

## Isolation invariants

- Forks are copies; **no cross-user `kody:@…` import ever resolves**.
- Deliberate cross-user data flows are public listing snapshots, aggregate
  ratings, and public profile / catalog surfaces.
- Private profiles and private packages (`profile_visibility = private`,
  `saved_packages.is_private = 1`) must not appear on public catalog reads.
- Package name scope and public profiles reveal the owner's username by design;
  browsing does not require exposing a stable owner user id on every search hit.
- Community results stay out of general MCP `search` and per-user package vector
  indexes.

Account deletion and export cover community activity through
`accountUserDataTargets` (`community_activity_events` by actor and by owned
listing), matching the multi-column pattern used for `community_reports`.
