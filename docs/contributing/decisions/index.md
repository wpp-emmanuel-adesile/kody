# Decision records

A **steering veto list**. Open the list below before proposing a new primitive,
surface, or storage home. Architecture docs and code describe how the system
works today; this folder records product-shaped decisions **already made**,
usually a no with a revisit-if.

Linked from the [contributor map](../index.md) (and the short
[AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) window into it) for that check — not as homework
and not as a museum.

A good record is half a page: context, the decision, consequences. See
[0025](./0025-no-package-services-primitive.md) for the shape that actually
steers (write the no before the next agent re-proposes the primitive).

Decision records are point-in-time documents, so they are exempt from
`npm run docs:check-temporal`; everything else in `docs/` describes current
behavior (see [documentation principles](../documentation.md)).

## When to add a record

Write one after you have already decided **not** to build something the next
agent will otherwise re-propose. Copy [`0000-template.md`](./0000-template.md)
to the next unused number (read this index on `main` first) with a kebab-case
slug. Keep it to roughly half a page.

Do **not** write an ADR on every PR. Number collisions (two 0022s, then two
0028s, then two 0029s the same day) are the failure mode of that habit. If a
number collides, renumber the later record; do not leave duplicates.
`npm run docs:check-decisions` (part of `npm run validate`) rejects duplicate
primary numbers. A lab note may share a number only as `NNNN-*-lab.md`.

Do **not** record layout or UI tweaks, mode assignments, or "we use library X"
unless that pick is a no that will otherwise be re-litigated.

When a later record changes a decision, mark the old one `superseded by NNNN`
rather than editing or deleting it, and list it under
[Historical / UI / implementation](#historical--ui--implementation).

Add new steering records to the steering list, not a catch-all numbered dump.

## Steering list

Open these before proposing a new primitive, surface, or storage home.

- [0001 — No user-facing package versioning or import pins](./0001-no-package-versioning.md)
- [0031 — `kody.dependencies` is a name-to-`*` map; still no pins or live resolution](./0031-kody-dependencies-wildcard-map.md)
- [0002 — Data placement: D1, per-user Durable Objects, Analytics Engine](./0002-data-placement.md)
- [0003 — Repos are the base primitive; packages are an explicit extension](./0003-repos-as-base-primitive.md)
- [0004 — Status page stays a separate worker with its own storage](./0004-status-page-separate-worker.md)
- [0005 — Keep the MCP legacy lane until metrics retire it; no Tasks yet](./0005-mcp-dual-lane-stateless-migration.md)
- [0006 — No repo/package CI primitive](./0006-no-repo-ci-primitive.md)
- [0007 — Keep in-house feature flags; no package flag primitive](./0007-keep-in-house-feature-flags.md)
- [0008 — No traces, previews, browser-run, gradual deploys, or session mining](./0008-declined-adlc-primitives.md)
- [0011 — Keep workers-unit per-file isolation; do not warm DOs to "fix" slowness](./0011-workers-unit-pool-harness.md)
- [0013 — Post-publish checks stay on MCP; no signed app URLs or inbox injection](./0013-synthetic-package-requests.md)
- [0036 — Person accounts do not run official platform packages](./0036-platform-packages-fork-only.md)
  — supersedes 0035 and the remaining execute-live half of 0014; fork, then use
  the copy
- [0037 — No author-facing `packages.invoke`](./0037-no-author-packages-invoke.md)
  — static import, `import(specifier)`, or workflows; HTTP-token ingress is
  [0048](./0048-webhooks-replace-invocation-tokens.md)
- [0048 — Inbound HTTP is webhooks; invocation tokens drain](./0048-webhooks-replace-invocation-tokens.md)
  — no `*` webhook URLs; token surfaces unadvertise after the soak; the HTTP
  token path drains until leftover rows are 0
- [0015 — Wait on Skills over MCP; serve skill content via packages](./0015-skills-over-mcp-wait.md)
- [0017 — Hosted package apps use per-user subdomains; same-owner isolation deferred](./0017-per-user-package-app-subdomains.md)
- [0020 — Repo sessions spill Workspace objects to R2; do not adopt `@cloudflare/computer`](./0020-repo-session-workspace-r2-not-computer.md)
- [0021 — Publish-gated packages; no in-process composition runtime](./0021-publish-gated-package-composition.md)
- [0022 — Retire the values primitive; do not add a thinner settings twin](./0022-retire-values-primitive.md)
- [0023 — Progressive search disclosure; no full-SDK dumps or unbounded listings](./0023-progressive-search-disclosure.md)
- [0024 — Packages outrank synthesized providers; no auto-delete or ranking toggle](./0024-packages-outrank-synthesized-providers.md)
- [0025 — No package services primitive](./0025-no-package-services-primitive.md)
- [0032 — No unattached jobs; schedules belong to packages or workflows](./0032-no-unattached-jobs.md)
- [0033 — No user-as-conversation, MCP session, or user-global memory hide](./0033-no-user-as-conversation.md)
  ([lab](./0033-memory-auto-surface-lab.md))
- [0026 — Invocation tokens belong to one package; no account-level wildcard bearer](./0026-package-owned-invocation-tokens.md)
- [0027 — No invocation-token source allowlist](./0027-no-invocation-token-source-allowlist.md)
- [0034 — Origin owns no Durable Object classes](./0034-origin-owns-no-durable-objects.md)
  — platform classes live on `kody-platform`; do not put them on origin,
  runtime, or jobs, and do not add a second origin-facing content worker
- [0041 — No hardcoded operator correspondence when an admin topic exists](./0041-no-hardcoded-operator-correspondence.md)
  — platform owns the fact and the event; packages own the reaction; no official
  `@kody/*` admin-notify package
- [0042 — No capability-input secret placeholders or capability allowlists](./0042-no-capability-input-secrets.md)
  — fetch host approval and package grants remain; do not re-add `x-kody-secret`
  input resolution or `allowed_capabilities`
- [0043 — Repo visibility is the share switch; no community-package kind](./0043-repo-visibility-no-community-kind.md)
  — no `package.json#private` SoT, no second publish semantics
  (`communityPublish` stays a visibility alias), no license bureau, no trusted
  listings
- [0044 — Retired brand domains stay retired](./0044-retired-brand-domains-stay-retired.md)
  — do not re-attach `heykody.app`, `heykody.dev`, or `kodyapps.dev` as app,
  package-app, status, or email hosts
- [0045 — Official guides load through search, not execute](./0045-guides-load-through-search.md)
  — `guide:{id}` entity detail is the read path; do not execute `codingGuideGet`
  just to load a guide
- [0046 — Community is the catalog; public is the visibility word](./0046-community-is-the-catalog.md)
  — no “community package” kind-name; do not rename `/community` or the MCP
  `community` domain; listing_* identifiers stay until a dual-declare cut
- [0047 — One Vectorize index with per-user namespaces until 5,000 users](./0047-vectorize-per-user-namespaces-until-5k-users.md)
  — no sharding or metadata-only filtering before 5k accounts; the shard shape
  is pre-decided for when it is needed
- [0049 — No MCP capability OAuth scopes](./0049-no-mcp-capability-oauth-scopes.md)
  — connecting an agent is one grant; `openid` / `profile` / `email` stay
  identity claims, not a permission menu
- [0050 — Package share grants are not platform scope grants](./0050-package-share-grants-are-not-scope-grants.md)
  — person-to-person `package_share_grants` stay separate from admin-minted
  platform `package_scope_grants`; grant `pin` is not an import specifier pin
- [0051 — Pro bills include → credits → stop](./0051-include-credits-stop.md) —
  at $0, usage past the include stops; no customer-facing fund-to-unlock rates
  and no free past-include burn; 50× is a credits ceiling, not a tier
- [0052 — OAuth refresh expectation comes from the token response](./0052-oauth-refresh-policy-from-token-response.md)
  — no app/adapter refresh defaults and no blanket `missing_refresh_token`
  Waiting suppression; wait only when the connect response implied refresh
- [0053 — Scoped API tokens are a separate credential class, not MCP OAuth scopes](./0053-scoped-api-tokens-are-not-mcp-oauth-scopes.md)
  — `kody_at_` tokens authenticate the Open API and CapabilityProxy; MCP OAuth
  stays one full grant; amended by 0055 for CLI login on local-execute HTTP and
  by 0056 for explicit session→CLI bootstrap codes
- [0054 — No vendor-specific platform logic](./0054-no-vendor-specific-platform-logic.md)
  — capabilities stay generic; third parties configure via params/presets, not
  `foo-hub`-style type forks in platform schema or handlers
- [0055 — CLI MCP OAuth may authenticate local-execute HTTP only](./0055-cli-mcp-oauth-local-execute-http.md)
  — `kody login` Bearer on CapabilityProxy + package-graph (full MCP grant);
  other Open API routes stay `kody_at_`-only; amended by 0056 for headless/agent
  bootstrap without a second interactive OAuth
- [0056 — Explicit MCP/API session → CLI credential bootstrap](./0056-cli-credential-bootstrap.md)
  — one-shot `kody_bc_…` code from `cliCredentialBootstrap` (capability + Open
  API); CLI redeems for `kody_at_…` without chat-facing secrets or host-token
  scavenging
- [0057 — No framework platform affordance for package bundles](./0057-no-framework-platform-affordance.md)
  — do not vendor, mount, inject, sniff, or rewrite package bundles for Remix,
  TanStack, Preact, or any other framework; packages bring frameworks themselves

## Historical / UI / implementation

Accepted or superseded records that do **not** change the next product proposal.

  — contributor infra, not a product primitive
- [0038 — Still no Nx Cloud; split self-hosted cache read and write tokens](./0038-no-nx-cloud-read-write-cache-tokens.md)
  — token split; who may write is 0040
- [0039 — Same-repo pull_request jobs do not write the Nx cache](./0039-no-same-repo-pr-cache-writes.md)
  — superseded by 0040
- [0040 — Same-repo writers may PUT the Nx cache; fork PRs may not](./0040-same-repo-writers-may-put-nx-cache.md)
  — push access already implies the local write token
- [0028 — List/detail records expand inside the table](./0028-list-detail-expand.md)
  — UI mode assignment (supersedes 0010)
- [0029 — Discord social login and official guild role](./0029-discord-social-login-and-guild-role.md)
  — superseded by 0030; invite-only membership is no longer the product path
- [0030 — Join the official Discord during social login](./0030-discord-guilds-join-on-social-login.md)
  — `guilds.join` on Discord social login; token still discarded after the
  callback
