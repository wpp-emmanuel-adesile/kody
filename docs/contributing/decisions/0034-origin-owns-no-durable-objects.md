# 0034: Origin owns no Durable Object classes

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-22

## Context

[0016](./0016-mono-worker-extraction.md) extracted the package-runtime and jobs
lanes and left Remix, blog, official guides, MCP HTTP, OAuth, inbound email, and
the remaining Durable Object classes on the origin `kody` script. Cloudflare
assigns Durable Object instances a Worker version: any `wrangler deploy` of the
script that **owns** those classes resets them
(`Durable Object reset because its code was updated`), including uploads that
only change static assets or markdown imported into the bundle.

Blog posts and Remix UI change more often than Durable Object code. Shipping
those from a DO-owning script resets live MCP sessions, mailboxes, repo
sessions, and other platform objects for a content edit.

Official guide markdown (`docs/guides/`) is also statically imported into the
MCP Durable Object (`codingGuideGet`). Those edits must upload `kody-platform`
as well as origin so web `/docs` and MCP stay on the same bundle; they still
skip `kody-runtime` and `kody-jobs`.

A second origin-facing content worker (`kody-app`) that forwards every page
would pay a second ~27MB bundle and a hop on every request, then still need this
same Durable Object transfer later. Do not land that shape.

## Decision

The origin-facing `kody` script owns **zero** Durable Object classes. Extract
the remaining platform classes onto `kody-platform`
(`packages/platform-worker/`): `MCP`, `McpClientHub`, `OAuthPurgeCoordinator`,
`UserMeter`, `Mailbox`, `RepoSession`, `RepoSessionIndex`, and
`StripePlanRefresh`. Leave `StorageRunner`, `RunLog`, and
`PackageRealtimeSession` on `kody-runtime`.

MCP HTTP, OAuth, inbound email, queues, and Remix stay on origin. Origin and
runtime bind the platform classes cross-script. Do not put platform classes on
runtime (untrusted package code) or jobs (different data seam).

`transferred_classes` is a one-shot cutover, not a soak. Preview uses
`new_sqlite_classes` (fresh workers). Production applies the transfer while
origin still exports the classes, then origin deploys with
`script_name: "kody-platform"`. Never `deleted_classes` for transferred classes.

Remix/blog/UI-only production deploys upload origin only. Official guide deploys
upload origin and platform.

## Consequences

Remix/blog/UI-only production deploys no longer reset platform or runtime
Durable Objects. Official guide deploys reset platform objects because MCP
bundles that markdown, and still skip runtime and jobs. Cost: another wrangler
config, callee-first preview deploy ordering (platform and runtime before the
origin, which uploads the same slim entry as production and never bootstraps
because a fresh preview has no storage to transfer), and a one-shot production
transfer with a short in-flight RPC error window. The platform script must also
export `KodyFetchGateway` (a WorkerEntrypoint, not a Durable Object) so MCP
`execute` can loopback outbound fetch from `ctx.exports` on the script that owns
`MCP`. See the
[platform worker migration runbook](../architecture/platform-worker-migration-runbook.md).
