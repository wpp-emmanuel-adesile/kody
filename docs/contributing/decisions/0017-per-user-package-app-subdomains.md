# 0017: Per-user subdomains for hosted package apps

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-11

## Context

Hosted package apps execute author-supplied HTML and JavaScript. Production
already isolates them from the first-party app origin via a separate registrable
domain (`PACKAGE_APP_BASE_URL`, `kodyapps.dev`) and credential stripping, but
every owner's apps still shared one origin on that domain. One user's package
could reach another user's `kody_pkg_session`-authorized endpoints from the
browser — a smaller blast radius than first-party access, but not zero.

Alternatives considered:

- **Stay on one shared package-app origin.** Simpler DNS and routing, but
  user-to-user browser isolation remains incomplete.
- **Per-package subdomains** (`{kodyId}.kodyapps.dev`). Stronger same-owner
  isolation, but multiplies DNS/certificate surface and complicates the handoff
  and `packageContext` contract for every package.
- **Path-only isolation with stricter CSP on package apps.** Would still leave
  same-origin cookie and storage sharing; CSP cannot be applied to author code
  without breaking real apps.

Usernames had allowed underscores, which are invalid in DNS labels and would
block `{username}.kodyapps.dev` for affected accounts.

## Decision

Serve production hosted package apps on **per-user subdomains** of the
package-app apex:

- Public URL shape: `https://{username}.kodyapps.dev/packages/{kodyId}/{path}`
- The apex (`kodyapps.dev`) serves no package code: `/` redirects to the app
  origin; legacy `/@user/packages/...` paths redirect to the owning subdomain;
  everything else `404`s.
- The app-origin path `/@{username}/packages/...` remains the authenticated
  entry point and redirects into the handoff on the owner's subdomain.
- Package-app session cookies on secure requests use the
  `__Host-kody_pkg_session` name so browsers reject any variant with a `Domain`
  attribute (cookie-tossing defense before Public Suffix List entry). Insecure
  local HTTP keeps plain `kody_pkg_session`.
- Serving requires session account username == subdomain label == path owner
  (fixation defense).
- Mutating requests on a subdomain require any `Origin` header to match the
  subdomain itself: sibling subdomains stay same-site until the PSL entry, so a
  `SameSite=Lax` cookie would otherwise attach to a cross-subdomain mutation
  from a browser holding sessions for two accounts.
- Usernames are strict DNS labels everywhere (lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens;
  underscores banned). A two-tier lenient-recognition scheme shipped briefly to
  protect legacy underscore accounts, but production had exactly one such
  account; it was renamed by hand (`users.username`, `email_inbox_addresses`,
  `saved_packages.name`) on 2026-08-12 and the lenient tier was removed the same
  day — no legacy affordances remain.
- `packageContext.appBasePath` on a subdomain is `/packages/{kodyId}` (no
  `/@{username}` prefix); inline non-production serving keeps the path-based
  mount. Well-behaved packages that use `hostedUrl` / `appBasePath` stay
  transparent.
- Untrusted markdown refuses `/packages/...` links on any host in addition to
  `/@...`.
- **Same-user package-to-package isolation is deliberately deferred:** two
  packages of one owner still share that owner's subdomain origin.
- **Operational follow-up:** submit `kodyapps.dev` to the Public Suffix List
  (`_psl` TXT record + PR to publicsuffix/list) for defense-in-depth.

## Consequences

- User-to-user browser isolation for hosted apps is complete; same-owner
  cross-package reachability remains an accepted residual risk (documented in
  [`security.md`](../security.md)).
- Production deploys require wildcard DNS and `kody.run/*` plus `*.kody.run/*`
  Worker routes on the runtime Worker (see
  [`setup-manifest.md`](../setup-manifest.md)). `kodyapps.dev` is not a product
  zone; do not attach Worker routes or submit that apex to the Public Suffix
  List ([0044](./0044-retired-brand-domains-stay-retired.md)). PSL follow-up, if
  any, is for `kody.run` ([`security.md`](../security.md)).
- The one production underscore account was renamed by hand on 2026-08-12; no
  underscore usernames remain, so no rename affordances exist in the app.
- `parsePackageSearchIdentity`, status probes, and author docs must recognize
  both subdomain URLs and the apex/path redirect shapes that still resolve to an
  owner's hosted app.
- Revisit per-package subdomains only if same-owner isolation becomes a reported
  abuse vector or a product requirement.

## Later update (2026-08-24)

The 2026-08-11 decision above used `kodyapps.dev` as the package-app apex. That
hostname is not rewritten here. The canonical package-app apex is `kody.run`
(`PACKAGE_APP_BASE_URL`). Production public URL shape is
`https://{username}.kody.run/packages/{kodyId}/{path}`. See
[`setup-manifest.md`](../setup-manifest.md) and [`security.md`](../security.md).

## Later update (2026-09-01)

`kodyapps.dev` is no longer a dual-served package-app zone. Production publishes
only the `kody.run` apex and wildcard zone routes. See
[0044](./0044-retired-brand-domains-stay-retired.md) and
[#1428](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kody/issues/1428).
