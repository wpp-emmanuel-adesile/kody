# 0037 — No author-facing `packages.invoke`

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-24

## Context

`packages.invoke` was a third composition primitive next to static `kody:@`
imports and workflows. Among user-owned modules (including forks), isolate entry
is not a trust boundary: an agent can publish another self-authored package. The
useful jobs invoke covered are already other primitives: a known name is a
static import; a name that is data is `import(specifier)`; exactly-once is a
workflow. HTTP invocation tokens are ingress, not author composition — they run
a named export and do not use the `kody:runtime` helper.

## Decision

Authors do not get `packages.invoke`.

- Name known at write time → static `import` from `kody:@scope/package/export`.
- Name is data → `import(specifier)` (caller-owned / forks). Computed `kody:@`
  imports load through a host library-load bridge that does not use
  author-facing `packages.invoke`
  ([#1750](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kody/issues/1750)).
- Exactly-once → workflows. Do not keep a keyed invoke beside them.
- External callers → inbound webhooks. HTTP invocation tokens
  (`POST /@:user/api/package-invocations/…`) remain only as an unadvertised
  drain. That path is not `packages.invoke`. See
  [0048](./0048-webhooks-replace-invocation-tokens.md).

The `kody:runtime` helper is deleted and no longer bound. `packages` remains an
exported name that is always `null` so leftover `if (packages)` guards still
typecheck and bundle; unguarded `packages.invoke(...)` fails with a message that
names the static import, `import(specifier)`, and workflows. Computed
`import(specifier)` does not depend on the helper.

## Consequences

Composition is import plus workflows. Agents stop seeing invoke in usage docs,
guides, and MCP copy. Fleet source migrates with package codemod
`0008-packages-invoke-to-static-import` (literal specifiers → static import,
including Markdown examples; computed specifiers → `import(specifier)`; keyed
invokes stay `needsManual` for workflows). Interactive MCP
`packageSubscriptionDispatch` is the post-publish subscription smoke test
([0013](./0013-synthetic-package-requests.md)), not a replacement for
`packages.invoke`.

Revisit only if computed `import(specifier)` cannot stand in for caller-owned
name-as-data loads now that the helper is deleted.
