# 0045: Official guides load through search, not execute

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-09-01

## Context

Official guide markdown (`docs/guides/`) used to be discovered with `search` and
then read by executing `codingGuideGet`. That second hop spins up an isolate for
a bundled read. Search already has `{type}:{id}` entity detail for capabilities,
packages, secrets, and integrations.

Agents that follow MCP instructions and walkthroughs still paid execute cost
every time they opened a guide. The next agent would otherwise keep teaching
`execute` + `codingGuideGet` as the read path.

## Decision

Official guides are search entities. Ranked `search({ query })` can return
`guide:{id}` hits. `search({ entity: "guide:{id}" })` returns the full bundled
markdown. Do not add an execute-only path for reading official docs, and do not
tell agents to execute `codingGuideGet` just to load a guide.

`codingGuideGet` stays for execute-module code that needs the markdown body
programmatically.

## Consequences

- MCP instructions, usage docs, and interactive transcripts teach
  `search({ entity: "guide:{id}" })`.
- Guide ranking lives on the guide entities, not on a kitchen-sink keyword list
  on `codingGuideGet`.
- Unadvertised guides stay omitted from ranked listings and remain callable by
  exact entity id.
- Revisit only if search entity detail cannot return the full guide body (size
  budget or a host that cannot follow `guide:{id}` refs).
