# Request lifecycle

This document explains how an incoming request moves through the system.

## Entry points

Production has two public HTTP entrypoints:

- **App origin** (`kody.codes`) — `packages/worker/src/index.ts`. Remix, MCP
  HTTP (`/mcp`), OAuth, inbound email, and queue consumers. Runtime-owned paths
  (`/@{username}/packages/…`, package-invocation API, inline `/apps`) forward
  over the `RUNTIME_WORKER` service binding to `kody-runtime`.
- **Package-app origin** (`kody.run`) — `packages/worker/src/runtime-worker.ts`.
  Zone routes on that script; the origin handler does not see this host in
  production.

The routing order below is the **app-origin** handler.

The default `fetch` handler delegates to `OAuthProvider` from
`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`, which means OAuth endpoints and token
infrastructure are available alongside normal app routes.

The provider requires `resourceMetadata.resource` (canonical `<origin>/mcp`).
That pins grant and access-token audiences and is the sole RFC 9728
protected-resource metadata document, served at
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`. The root
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` path is not an alias. Preview, local,
and production each construct a per-origin provider so the resource matches the
host the client connected to (`getAppBaseUrl`). Production refuses non-canonical
hosts (see [Non-canonical hosts](../security.md#non-canonical-hosts)), so MCP is
not served on the production `workers.dev` trigger. `APP_BASE_URL` is only the
fallback for background work with no request URL.

## Routing order

Requests are handled in this order:

0. Production canonical-host check
   (`packages/worker/src/app/canonical-host.ts`): if the runtime is production
   and the request host is not the `APP_BASE_URL` host, not a package-app
   apex/subdomain (`parsePackageAppRequestHost`), and not an `APP_LEGACY_HOSTS`
   entry, the Worker returns `404` `{ error: 'not_found' }` with
   `Cache-Control: no-store`. `GET /health` is exempt so deploy health checks
   and the status worker can probe the script on the `workers.dev` trigger.
   Preview and local skip this check. Platform and runtime workers apply the
   same rule with `/__platform/health` and `/__runtime/health` as their probe
   exemptions.
1. Package-app host isolation (see
   [Hosted package app origin isolation](../security.md#hosted-package-app-origin-isolation)):
   - On the **package-app apex**, no package code runs: `/` redirects to the app
     origin; legacy `/@{username}/packages/*` redirects to the owning user's
     subdomain; everything else is `404`.
   - On a **per-user package-app subdomain** (`{username}.<package-app host>`),
     only `/packages/{kodyId}/*` for that hostname's username is served (plus
     the handoff-token exchange on those same paths). `/` redirects to the app
     origin; every other path is `404`.
   - On the **app origin**, `/@{username}/packages/*` never executes package
     code: safe methods redirect to the owner's package-app subdomain with a
     handoff token, other methods get a `307` to that subdomain.
   - Production package-app requests fail with `500` when `PACKAGE_APP_BASE_URL`
     is missing or is not on a separate registrable domain from `APP_BASE_URL`;
     package code never executes inline.
   - In confirmed local, preview, and test runtimes, an unset package-app origin
     is a no-op and package apps are served inline at step 10 below.
2. Public OAuth metadata (before `OAuthProvider`):
   - OpenID Connect discovery: `/.well-known/openid-configuration` (`GET` /
     `HEAD` / `OPTIONS`) — includes `revocation_endpoint` at `/oauth/token`
     (same URL RFC 8414 authorization-server metadata advertises) plus matching
     `revocation_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`.
   - JWKS: `/.well-known/jwks.json` (`GET` / `HEAD` / `OPTIONS`)
   - Client ID Metadata Document: `/oauth/client-metadata.json` (`GET` / `HEAD`
     / `OPTIONS`) — Kody-as-client CIMD. Served from the request origin so
     `client_id` matches the fetch URL.
   - Official CLI CIMD: `/oauth/cli-client-metadata.json` (`GET` / `HEAD` /
     `OPTIONS`) — `@kodycodes/cli` presents this URL as `client_id`. Loopback
     redirect is `http://127.0.0.1:43742/callback`.
3. OAuth authorization endpoints:
   - `/oauth/authorize`
   - `/oauth/authorize-info`
   - `/oauth/callback`
4. Browser noise endpoint:
   - `/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json` (returns 204)
5. OAuth protected resource metadata (inside `OAuthProvider`, path-aware only):
   - `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`
6. MCP endpoint:
   - `/mcp` (requires OAuth bearer token; `OAuthProvider` `apiRoute`). Missing
     Bearer credentials are short-circuited with a JSON `401` (Gemini-friendly)
     before the library's empty-bodied challenge. After authentication,
     `packages/worker/src/mcp-auth.ts` routes by protocol era: 2025-era requests
     go to the sessionful `MCP` Durable Object (`McpAgent`, MCP SDK v1) hosted
     on `kody-platform` and reached through the `MCP_OBJECT` binding, and
     `2026-07-28` envelope requests are served statelessly per request by
     `packages/worker/src/mcp/stateless-lane.ts` (MCP SDK v2, no Durable
     Object). Tokens that lack the resource's `requiredScopes` (OIDC baseline)
     get the library `insufficientScope()` step-up `403`. Both lanes share one
     tool registration; every authenticated request records a lane data point to
     the `MCP_PROTOCOL_EVENTS` Analytics Engine dataset for dual-lane traffic
     measurement (see
     [decision 0005](../decisions/0005-mcp-dual-lane-stateless-migration.md)).
     The origin script owns no Durable Object classes
     ([ADR 0034](../decisions/0034-origin-owns-no-durable-objects.md)). MCP
     `execute` looks up `KodyFetchGateway` on `ctx.exports` of the script that
     **owns** `MCP` — that is `kody-platform`. Origin
     `POST /__maintenance/execute-smoke` is **origin-only**: it uses origin
     `ctx.exports` and returns `scope: "origin-only"`,
     `proves: "origin-kody-fetch-gateway"`, and `notMcpExecute: true`. A passing
     smoke does not prove MCP execute health. Authenticated execute evidence is
     the traffic-backed heartbeat plus the hourly
     `POST /__maintenance/mcp-execute-health` fallback (legacy `/mcp` execute
     with a dedicated canary token). The public card is recent for one hour
     after organic or synthetic success; organic traffic alone is enough. Public
     health and status GETs do not run that probe. A status-page snapshot older
     than the one-minute skip window may re-read origin `GET /health/components`
     `executeEvidence` (never execute) so organic last-success is not one cron
     tick behind the live heartbeat. Persist merges with any newer timestamp
     written while that fetch was in flight.
   - Catchable throws while serving `/mcp` (including through `OAuthProvider`'s
     `apiHandler`) are mapped to an HTTP JSON-RPC `-32603` Internal error
     response on the same connection so MCP clients see a failed request instead
     of an OAuth `{ error: "server_error" }` body or a Cloudflare 1101 from a
     rethrown exception. Real OAuth routes keep their RFC 6749 error shape.
     Isolate kills are outside this catch.
7. Public `@username` ingress handled in `packages/worker/src/index.ts` before
   the OAuth provider / app router (needs `ExecutionContext` for background
   work). Production forwards package-invocation and package-app paths to
   `kody-runtime` via `RUNTIME_WORKER`; webhook ingress stays on origin:
   - `POST /@{username}/api/package-invocations/:kodyId/:exportName` —
     unadvertised bearer-token drain (see
     [package invocation API](../package-invocation-api.md))
   - `POST /@{username}/webhooks/:packageKodyId/:webhookName/:urlSecret` —
     inbound package webhooks (see [Inbound webhooks](./webhooks.md))
   - Retired `/@{username}/connectors/...` paths return `404`. Use outbound MCP
     servers (`kody.mcp[...]`) for home automation and similar tools.

8. Static assets:
   - Served from `ASSETS` for `GET` and `HEAD` when available
   - Matching files under `packages/worker/public/` are asset-first at the edge
     (they do not enter this Worker list) unless listed in
     `assets.run_worker_first`
9. Hosted package apps served inline on the app origin
   (`/@{username}/packages/*`), only in confirmed non-production runtimes when
   `PACKAGE_APP_BASE_URL` is unset.
10. App server routes:

- Everything else is handled by `packages/worker/src/app/handler.ts`
- Public agent-discovery documents (Worker-first, origin-aware) include
  `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/auth.md`,
  `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`, `/.well-known/api-catalog`,
  `/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`, skill markdown under
  `/.well-known/agent-skills/:skillId/SKILL.md`, `/.well-known/security.txt`,
  and OpenAI Apps domain verification at `/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge`
  (unauthenticated `text/plain` token). The homepage adds RFC 8288 `Link`
  headers to those documents and serves markdown when `Accept` prefers
  `text/markdown`. DNS-AID (`_mcp._agents.<apex>` SVCB/HTTPS) is zone DNS, not a
  Worker route.

## Package-app realtime (WebSocket)

A browser
`new WebSocket('wss://{username}.kody.run/packages/{kodyId}/ws[/facet]')`
reaches `kody-runtime` directly through the `*.kody.run` zone routes (inline
dev/preview reaches it through the origin `RUNTIME_WORKER` forward).
`servePackageAppRequest` recognizes the upgrade (`Upgrade` compared
case-insensitively) before any package `app_fetch` runs and calls
`packageRealtimeSessionRpc(...).connect`, which forwards to the
`PackageRealtimeSession` Durable Object. The DO runs the package connect hook
(one `app_realtime` run) and returns `101` with the client socket.

workerd sends any `fetch` that carries `Upgrade: websocket` as a WebSocket
handshake and **drops the request body**, so the DO connect payload (binding,
facet, browser request) travels in the `X-Kody-Realtime-Connect` header, never
the body. Only a real cross-isolate stub call proves this; calling the DO
instance's `fetch` in-process keeps the body and hides the bug
(`realtime-session.workers.test.ts` uses the real stub).

Post-deploy check for a package with realtime hooks (for example PR Desk):

1. `GET https://kody.run/__runtime/health` reports the merge `commitSha`.
2. Open `https://{username}.kody.run/packages/{kodyId}` signed in. DevTools →
   Network → WS shows the `/ws` request with status `101 Switching Protocols`.
3. From Kody MCP, `runList` for that package with `surface: 'app_realtime'`
   since the reopen shows a connect run, and `sessionList({ package_id })` lists
   the open session.

A non-101 `/ws` with no `app_realtime` row means the host or DO failed before
the hook ran (look for Sentry `package_app.phase: realtime-connect`). An
`app_fetch` `426` row on `/ws` means the upgrade was not recognized and fell
through to package code.

## Workflow runtime

All server-side Kody runtime contexts expose `workflows` from `kody:runtime`.
The helper routes every call to the shared `DynamicCallableWorkflow` binding;
there is no separate context-specific Workflow class.

- `workflows.create({ code, workflowName?, runAt, idempotencyKey, params })`
  queues an inline ESM module and later executes it through the same module
  loader used by `execute`. Omitted `workflowName` falls back to `inline-code`.
- `workflows.create({ exportName, packageId?, workflowName?, runAt, idempotencyKey, params })`
  queues a saved-package export invocation. Package runtime contexts resolve
  `packageId` from `packageContext`; ad hoc contexts must pass it explicitly.
  Omitted `workflowName` falls back to the export path.
- The hub verifies saved-package ownership before queuing export-backed
  workflows and records recent workflow rows for `workflowRunList`.

## App server flow

`packages/worker/src/app/handler.ts` validates environment variables and
configures session cookie signing (`COOKIE_SECRET`) before creating the app
router.

Authenticated HTML requests resolve the user row and RBAC roles in one D1
`batch`, start feature-flag evaluation (global flags + per-user overrides in a
second `batch`) as soon as the user id is known, and `renderAppPage` awaits that
already-started promise after page data instead of opening a new D1 wave.
Anonymous callers still receive registry flag defaults without touching D1.

`packages/worker/src/app/router.ts` maps route patterns from
`packages/worker/universal/routes.ts` to handler modules (home, auth, account,
session, logout, password reset, health).

## Anonymous marketing HTML cache

`renderAppPage` sets
`Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=300` and
`Vary: Cookie` for anonymous `/`, `/pricing`, `/blog`, `/community`,
`/onboarding`, `/docs`, and `/docs/:slug`. Origin `fetch` stores those
cookie-less `GET`/`HEAD` responses in the Cache API (`caches.default`), keyed on
the canonical origin + pathname + search and a `__accept=html` marker. Requests
whose `Accept` prefers `text/markdown` (`prefersMarkdown`) skip the store. A
matching HTML request with no `kody_session` cookie and no `Authorization`
header is served from that store (`X-Kody-Cache: HIT`) without running the app
handler. A miss runs the handler and, when the response is `200` `text/html`
with no `Set-Cookie` and already carries that Cache-Control, `ctx.waitUntil`
buffers a clone and stores it only once the body has reached `</html>`
(`isCompleteHtmlDocument`); a streamed document that stopped early (render
failure, client abort) is never shared. The stored copy drops `Vary: Cookie`
because Cloudflare's Cache API does not use `Vary` as a key (the lookup already
excludes cookie-bearing requests). Hits restore the browser-facing `Vary` from
the miss (`Cookie`, plus `Accept` on negotiated routes). Browser-facing
`Cache-Control` is unchanged. `Cache-Control: no-cache` on the request skips the
lookup so e2e can assert fresh HTML. Under `WRANGLER_IS_LOCAL_DEV=true`
(`npm run dev`, the Playwright web server) the store is bypassed entirely:
workerd honors `stale-while-revalidate` and persists `caches.default` under
`.wrangler/state`, so a stored page would keep replaying for minutes after the
edit that changed it. The `workers-unit` suite still exercises the store.

The public package surfaces (`/@:username/:kodyId`,
`/@:username/:kodyId/tree/:ref/*`, `/@:username/:kodyId/raw/:ref/*`,
`/community/:id`, `/community/:id/files/*`, `/community/:id/raw/*`) and their
JSON companions (`/profiles/:username/packages/:kodyId.json`,
`/community/:id.json`, `.../files.json`) are shared too, but with
`public, max-age=60` and no stale-while-revalidate: an owner can unpublish or
make a package private and nothing purges shared caches, so a stale public
response is bounded to one minute. They are shared only when the document is a
`200` (a `401` or `404` to a stranger stays `no-store` so making a package
public takes effect at once) and, for JSON, when the request has no session
cookie and the payload carries no viewer state. JSON companions are not stored
in the Cache API (the store is HTML-only). Anonymous `/onboarding.json` and
`/landing-hero-videos.json` use the marketing policy (the playlist payload is
also KV-cached with SWR). `/docs/:slug.json` is publicly cacheable without a
cookie vary (the payload is identical for every visitor). The response stays
`no-store` when the request carries a `kody_session` cookie, `loadSessionInfo`
resolves a session, or the response sets a cookie. Auth, OAuth, account, and
every other HTML path stay `no-store`.

## Request context

`handleRequest` wraps the router in `runWithRequestContext`
(`packages/worker/src/request-context.ts`): an `AsyncLocalStorage` store, also
keyed by `Request`, holding a per-request memo and the Server-Timing entries.
`memoizePerRequest` dedupes lookups a page needs more than once — the package
handler, the streaming `community-detail` frame, and the files loader all
resolve the same `loadPackagePage`, and the tree page resolves the same
Artifacts HEAD from two loaders. Callers that hold the `Request` pass it, since
SSR frames render after the async scope has exited; repo-layer code without a
request falls back to the store. Without any context the helpers just run the
load, so unit tests and jobs are unaffected.

## Page Server-Timing

`renderAppPage` and page JSON companions emit an HTTP `Server-Timing` header
with request-scoped phases (`{ name, durationMs, desc? }`, same helper as
execute). Cloudflare may append `cfEdge` / `cfOrigin` / `cfWorker`. App phases
are:

- `session` — `loadSessionInfo`
- `ssr` — route preload, stylesheet, and starting the HTML stream
- `highlight` — token batch (`desc` is `hit`, `worker`, `miss`, or `fallback`)
- `listings` — onboarding featured/chooser load
- `package-page` — `loadPackagePage` (URL resolution, viewer, listing and owner
  detail), recorded once per request thanks to the memo; nested inside it:
  `resolve-url`, `auth`, `listing` (public listing + source row on a data-cache
  miss), `artifacts-head` (cached default-branch HEAD), `owner-package`
- `owner-readme` — README read from the owner's published source snapshot
- `files-route` — tree URL canonicalization for `/tree/:ref` and `/files`
- `files` — tree snapshot read (KV, then the listing pin snapshot)

Loader phases recorded through `recordServerTiming` land on the request context
and are merged into the header by `renderAppPage`, the package JSON companions,
and frame responses.

Signed-in `/onboarding` derives the setup checklist from verification, inbound
MCP OAuth grants (first and second host), a Step 2 access win (memory, execute,
or saved package), and the saved-package meter. The payload also includes
featured community listings so persist-prompt copy can name an already-installed
example, plus a known memory subject or saved-package name when one exists so
Step 3 can show that artifact. The optional first-win email loop is not a
checklist item and does not run Mailbox probes on this page. See
[onboarding process](./onboarding.md).

Durations use `Date.now()`, which Workers only advance across I/O. The weekly
site-perf collector records these phases; it does not budget them.

## Syntax highlighting

Browser pages that show code — markdown bodies on guides, blog posts, and
community READMEs, onboarding MCP config snippets, and JSON dumps on account
jobs/activity — highlight with [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) on the
`kody-highlight` worker. Origin loaders POST snippets over the `HIGHLIGHT`
service binding (`POST /highlight`) and attach serializable token trees to
loader/API data. The browser only paints those tokens as Remix JSX text and
inline styles — never `innerHTML` — so untrusted README fences stay inside the
markdown safety model. Light and dark tokens follow `prefers-color-scheme` via
CSS variables in `packages/worker/public/styles.css`. Shiki grammars are not
part of the browser bundle; missing tokens render as escaped plaintext in the
same wrapper. Both origin and the highlight worker cache token batches keyed by
highlighter version.

## Client-side navigation flow

The browser app intercepts same-origin `<a>` clicks and same-origin form
submissions (`GET`/`POST`) and routes them in-place through the client router.
Normal app navigations stay in-place through the client router instead of
requiring a full document refresh.

### Preload-then-commit

SPA navigations use a **preload-then-commit** model (similar to React Router
data routers): before `history.pushState` and the route swap, the client router
runs a registered **route loader** for the destination URL, fetches JSON API
data, and stores it in a single-slot preloaded navigation store. Only after the
loader finishes (or is skipped when no loader matches) does the router commit
the URL change and notify subscribers. Route components consume that payload
synchronously on first render via `tryConsumeRouteLoaderData`, so the UI updates
once with data already present instead of swapping routes into a loading state.
Because consumption mutates route closure state mid-render, a successful consume
also schedules one follow-up render of the consuming component (flushed in the
same microtask, before paint); values a route derived before the consume call
therefore cannot persist stale. Routes should still consume before deriving
list/detail state — the follow-up render is a safety net, not the primary
ordering contract.

Route loaders are registered in `packages/worker/client/routes/index.tsx` under
`clientRouteLoaders`, keyed by `routePattern(routes.<name>)`. The same keying
scheme is used by `clientRoutes` and `document-head.ts`, so pathname renames
flow from `packages/worker/universal/routes.ts` instead of duplicated literal
strings. OAuth authorize/callback are the exception: those shells use
`oauthPaths.authorize` and `oauthPaths.callback` because the Cloudflare OAuth
provider wrapper, not `routes.ts`, owns those pathnames. Loaders still match
with the same Remix route-pattern specificity as `clientRoutes`. They return a
`RouteLoaderRedirect` (via `routeLoaderRedirect`) to abort the SPA navigation
with a full-document redirect (for example, `401` → login). The router performs
the redirect, never the loader itself, so speculative loader runs stay side-
effect free. Loader errors still commit the navigation so the destination route
can fall back to its own fetch; the router marks the destination stale
(`markNavigationDataStale`) so same-path refreshes — where no href change would
otherwise trigger a refetch — still reload. Hash-only changes commit immediately
without a loader. Back/forward (`popstate`) and same-path refreshes after form
POST also run loaders before notifying, keeping the previous UI visible until
data is ready.

### Intent prefetch

Like React Router's `prefetch="intent"`, the client router speculatively runs
the destination's route loader when the user shows intent to navigate —
`mouseover`, `focusin`, or `touchstart` on a same-origin link with a registered
loader (`intent-prefetch.ts`). A single latest-wins slot holds the speculative
run; hovering a different link aborts the previous prefetch. When the click
lands, the navigation adopts the in-flight or freshly settled prefetch instead
of starting the loader from scratch; results expire after a short TTL and
failures fall back to a normal loader run. Form POSTs abort any pending prefetch
so pre-mutation data is never shown. Opt a link out with `data-prefetch="none"`.
Rendered lists can also warm many destinations at once (`prefetchRouteHrefs`).
Onboarding chips share one `/onboarding.json` payload; docs sidebar slugs do
not, so they pass `{ independent: true }` and run one loader per href.

A thin top-of-viewport **navigation progress bar** listens for `navigationstart`
/ `navigationend` on `routerEvents` and appears only when a navigation is still
pending after a short delay.

The app shell also mounts **scroll restoration**. Each history entry's
`window.scrollY` is stored in `sessionStorage` keyed by `history.state.key` (the
same `{ [key]: y }` map React Router uses). A blocking inline script in the SSR
document body restores that Y before first paint on a full document load, so a
refresh does not flash the top of the page. After hydration the restorer keeps
applying the same saved Y until the document is tall enough to reach it, then
keeps pinning that Y through a short settle window so late layout (images,
fonts, scroll anchoring) cannot persist a drifted position. User input ends the
pin early. A persist of the current `scrollY` does not replace a taller saved Y
while that Y is still unreachable, so a clamped early `scrollTo` cannot
overwrite the intended position. `history.scrollRestoration` is `manual` so the
browser does not fight the restorer. SPA back/forward still restores the saved
position, hash targets scroll into view, and new navigations go to the top after
the destination route commits. Same-document hash links are intercepted like
other same-origin links so restoration can scroll to the target. Preserve the
current scroll for a specific intercepted link or form with
`data-prevent-scroll-reset`, or for programmatic navigation with
`navigate(to, { preventScrollReset: true })`.

Full page navigations occur for:

- Explicit browser reloads/new tab loads
- Cross-origin links/forms
- Non-`_self` form targets (for example, `_blank`)
- Explicit code paths that intentionally call `window.location.assign(...)`

## CORS behavior

`packages/worker/src/index.ts` wraps the handler with `withCors`
(`getCorsHeaders`):

- For `/mcp`, any `Origin` is reflected so browser-hosted remote MCP clients can
  connect: allowed methods are `GET, HEAD, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS`, allowed
  headers include the MCP protocol headers, and `WWW-Authenticate` /
  `Mcp-Session-Id` are exposed so clients can read the OAuth challenge.
- For every other path, CORS headers are only added when `Origin` exactly
  matches the request origin; allowed methods are `GET, POST, OPTIONS` and
  allowed headers include `content-type` and `authorization`.

This keeps cross-origin behavior narrow while allowing same-origin browser and
API requests, plus the deliberate `/mcp` exception.

## Observability (Sentry and Workers tracing)

The Worker default export is wrapped with `Sentry.withSentry` from
`@sentry/cloudflare` (see `packages/worker/src/index.ts`) so incoming `fetch`
requests are traced and uncaught errors can be reported when `SENTRY_DSN` is
configured.

The **MCP** (`MCP` / `MCP_OBJECT`) Durable Object is wrapped with
`Sentry.instrumentDurableObjectWithSentry` (see
`packages/worker/src/mcp/index.ts`) because it runs in a separate isolate from
the top-level Worker.

The MCP server flow adds one more Durable Object:

- The MCP client hub Durable Object terminates outbound websocket connections to
  user-configured MCP servers and proxies JSON-RPC/MCP requests over those
  sockets.

The runtime capability registry **merges** synthesized domains from enabled
**MCP client servers**. See [MCP client servers](./mcp-client-servers.md).

Shared options are built in `packages/worker/src/sentry-options.ts`: **release**
comes from `APP_COMMIT_SHA` when set (deploy workflows pass it as a var), and
**environment** defaults from `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` in
`packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc` per deploy target.

MCP tools emit structured `mcp-event` logs via
`packages/worker/src/mcp/observability.ts`. On failures, the same module sends
Sentry events at **error** severity (with MCP tags and context). Failures the
caller can clear from the message alone — `McpCallerError`,
`failurePhase: 'parse_input'`, or an explicit `callerError` payload flag,
including sandbox user-code failures — stay on the structured `mcp-event` log
line and never reach Sentry; genuine platform failures still do. New "not found
/ bad argument" throw sites in `packages/worker/src/mcp/**` should use
`McpCallerError`.

`search` also publishes exclusive wall-clock tiles (`rateLimitMs`,
`usernameLookupMs`, `identityResolutionMs`, `loadAndRankMs`, suffix stamps,
`waitingItemsMs`, `formattingMs`) plus `exclusiveMs` / `unaccountedMs` so named
phases reconcile against `timing.durationMs`. Overlapping detail (memory,
retrievers, candidate plugins) stays beside those tiles and is not summed. Each
call writes one privacy-safe point to `MCP_SEARCH_EVENTS` (see
[Usage metering — MCP search duration](./usage-metering.md#mcp-search-duration)).
Operators asking "is search slow this hour?" query that dataset; UWD `retriever`
surface attribution is unchanged and does not measure search latency.
`/admin/insights` has no search-latency chart. The same page does show the
onboarding funnel (`ONBOARDING_FUNNEL_EVENTS`): unique users per stage for the
last 7 and 28 days. See
[Usage metering — Onboarding funnel](./usage-metering.md#onboarding-funnel).

Authentication and authorization denials are deliberately **not**
`McpCallerError`. `/mcp` rejects anonymous callers at the transport before any
capability runs, so a denial reaching a handler means an internal caller built a
context without a user — a defect worth an issue. Attack visibility for these
lives in the audit log rather than the error stream; see
[Security](../security.md).

### Workers native tracing (OpenTelemetry)

`packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc` also enables
[Workers automatic tracing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/traces/)
(`observability.traces.enabled`, beta). The runtime emits OTel-standard spans
for handler invocations, outbound fetches, and binding calls (D1, KV, R2,
Durable Objects, queues) with no SDK in the bundle; traces appear in the Workers
Observability dashboard next to Workers Logs, and `console.*` output inside a
span is attributed to that span. Custom spans are available via
`tracing.enterSpan()` from `cloudflare:workers` when application-level spans are
worth adding. App-level context rides on two hooks: every metered usage event
emits a `kody.usage.{eventType}` child span with `kody.user_id` and entity
attributes (see [usage-metering.md](./usage-metering.md)), and Sentry error
events carry the signed-in user id (id only, no PII) via `Sentry.setUser` in the
app auth resolver and the MCP failure reporter.

Production deploys additionally export these traces to Sentry through the
account-level `sentry-otlp-traces` destination; preview and test deploys inherit
the top-level block without a destination, so their spans stay in the Cloudflare
dashboard. The destination itself (endpoint, auth header, fork provisioning) is
documented in [setup-manifest.md](../setup-manifest.md), and the
`SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` handling (production pins it to `0` to avoid
duplicate SDK traces) in
[environment-variables.md](../environment-variables.md).

Billing note: each span is one observability event sharing the Workers Logs
quota (10M events/month included on Workers Paid). Sampling is controlled by
`observability.traces.head_sampling_rate` (defaults to full sampling, fine at
current traffic).

### Browser errors and session replay

The client bundle initializes `@sentry/browser` from a `kody:sentry` meta tag
that `ssr-document.tsx` renders when `SENTRY_DSN` is configured (the DSN is a
publishable client key), except under `WRANGLER_IS_LOCAL_DEV` so Vite HMR noise
does not report as production. Capture is errors plus **error-only Session
Replay**: `replaysSessionSampleRate` is `0` and `replaysOnErrorSampleRate` is
`1`, so nothing is recorded to Sentry unless an error occurs, and replays mask
all text and block all media (`packages/worker/client/sentry-client.ts`) because
Kody sessions contain personal content. Envelopes are sent through the
same-origin `POST /sentry-tunnel` route
(`packages/worker/src/app/handlers/sentry-tunnel.ts`), which only forwards
envelopes whose DSN matches the Worker's own `SENTRY_DSN` — this keeps the
first-party CSP at `connect-src 'self'`. Because that DSN is public, the route
is also rate limited per IP before it buffers a body (see
[security.md](../security.md)). The CSP allows `worker-src blob:` for the replay
compression Web Worker.

### Source maps

`packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc` sets
[`upload_source_maps`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#source-maps),
and production deploys pass
`--outdir .wrangler/sentry-bundle --upload-source-maps` so the bundle + maps are
generated consistently. Wrangler resolves that `--outdir` against the config
file's directory, so platform and runtime maps land under
`packages/platform-worker/.wrangler/sentry-bundle` and
`packages/runtime-worker/.wrangler/sentry-bundle`. Origin maps come from
`vite build` (`dist/ssr` plus `dist/client`). `npm run deploy` from a laptop is
origin-only.

To symbolicate stack traces in **Sentry** (not only in Cloudflare), configure
[Cloudflare source maps in Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/sourcemaps/):
add GitHub **repository variables** `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT`, a
`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` **secret** with release upload scopes, then CI runs
`npm run sentry:upload-sourcemaps` after deploy using the same **release** as
`APP_COMMIT_SHA`. Sibling-only deploys upload the worker bundles that exist and
skip client maps when origin Vite did not run.
