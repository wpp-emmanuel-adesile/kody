Kody records per-user usage events at runtime chokepoints for cost attribution,
admin cohort views, and abuse detection. This document describes the event
schema, the `recordUsage()` helper contract, which chokepoints are instrumented,
and the recipe for instrumenting a new chokepoint.

Deliberately out of scope: quotas, plans, billing, enforcement, and admin
dashboards (see [Entitlements](./entitlements.md) for plan limits). This
document covers event capture and rollups only.

## Per-user isolation

Usage metering follows the repo-wide isolation invariant: every event carries a
required `userId`, the Analytics Engine index is the `userId`, and the D1 rollup
table is keyed by `user_id`. Admin and account reads stay scoped to one user.

## The event schema

One schema covers every chokepoint. It is defined in
`packages/worker/src/usage/record-usage.ts`:

```ts
type UsageEvent = {
	userId: string // required; owning user
	eventType: UsageEventType // see the metric table below
	entityId?: string | null // metered entity id when one exists
	durationMs?: number | null // wall-clock duration of the metered unit
	cpuMs?: number | null // CPU time, only when the platform exposes it
	bytes?: number | null // bytes moved/stored when meaningful
	eventCount?: number // coalesced units in one write; defaults to 1
	outcome: 'success' | 'error'
	timestamp?: string // ISO 8601; defaults to time of recording
	surface?: string | null // closed UWD surface; AE blob6
	executeShape?: string | null // execute thin/glue class; AE blob7
	cacheReuse?: 'hit' | 'miss' | null // billing-aligned LOADER reuse; AE blob8
	codeChars?: number | null // module-graph text length; AE double4
	paramsChars?: number | null // stable JSON length of params; AE double5
	packageId?: string | null // saved package id when known; AE blob9 (empty = Ad hoc)
}
```

`eventType` is a closed union defined in the dependency-free
`packages/worker/universal/usage-event-types.ts` (re-exported by
`record-usage.ts`). Add new members there (never ad hoc strings at call sites)
so the set of metrics stays reviewable in one place. The feature-flag registry
declares flag success metrics against this union, and the flag-exposure stream
(`FLAG_EXPOSURES` dataset, see
[feature-flags.md](./feature-flags.md#success-metrics)) is joined with these
events for the admin on/off cohort readout.

Runs after the response. Tailed isolates use a separate Loader cache id (`-cpu1` suffix) so cached tail-less isolates cannot skip it; `entityId` stays the stable worker id. `outcome` is the isolate's platform outcome, not the sandbox result.

Other per-user RPC factories can adopt the same helper; UserMeter, Mailbox, RunLog, and RepoSessionIndex stay unwrapped so admin usage reads do not inflate the metric.

Queued into the same per-burst coalescer as duration, so one run writes one point per (user, class, outcome, packageId).

Observe-only cost visibility on admin usage; never in include, credit debit, or warning math.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | DO class name                                                                                                            |
| `api_call`                          | one Open API operation (`api.kody.codes`, the MCP `api` tool, a CapabilityProxy hop, or local-execute package-graph prep)                                                                                                                                  | `packages/worker/src/open-api/invoke.ts` (`invokeApiOperation`), including CapabilityProxy / package-graph scope failures that run through invoke, and CapabilityProxy auth failures metered from `http-handler` when the token resolves to a user. Observe-only. Local-execute native failure entity ids append `:<ApiErrorCode>` (e.g. `capabilityProxySession:insufficient_scope`, `localExecutePackageGraph:package_import_unresolved`). The capability behind the operation meters itself as usual; local-execute CPU is never recorded. Package-graph prep is not `execute` / `dynamic_worker_day`.                                                                                    | operation id, or `capability-proxy:<path>` for proxy hops; CapabilityProxy / package-graph failures may append `:<code>` |

`email_received` covers receive attempts once an inbound message is routed to a
known, enabled inbox: stored messages record `success`; unverified-account
rejections, size rejections, entitlement rejections, and parse failures record
`error`. The `bytes` field always carries the raw message size, including for
rejected mail. Mail rejected before inbox resolution (unknown alias, disabled
inbox) has no owning user and is not metered.

`createMeteredDurableObjectStub` must not wrap the RpcStub as the Proxy target.
Cloudflare RPC binds stub methods to the receiver; a Proxy-of-stub is not a
valid RPC receiver, so every StorageRunner call throws "Proxy could not be
serialized because it is not a valid RPC receiver type". That includes
`packageStorage()` get of a missing key on export, subscription, job, and
execute — `storageRunnerRpc` is the only production call site, so one broken
wrapper fails every surface that touches package storage. The wrapper is a
plain-object Proxy that `Reflect.get` / `Reflect.apply`s against the original
stub. Local and workers-unit `env` omit `USAGE_EVENTS`, which skips the wrapper;
tests that need the production path bind a stub Analytics Engine dataset.

### Durable Object rows-read policy

Cloudflare bills SQLite-backed Durable Objects for rows read, including
key-value `get()` / `list()` calls on their hidden table. Kody splits that cost
by who controls the query shape:

- **Customer (`durable_object_rows_read`)** — StorageRunner, the per-bucket
  store behind `storage.*` and `packageStorage()`. SQL uses the cursor's real
  `rowsRead`; the KV API exposes no cursor, so reads use Cloudflare's documented
  per-key / per-entry billing unit. `exportStorage` is platform-initiated
  (account export, backup) and stays unmetered. This is the include / credit
  debit meter.
- **Platform (`durable_object_platform_rows_read`)** — RunLog run history. Its
  reads come from Kody's own queries (one RunLog hot spot read ~14B rows/day on
  one account), so they are recorded for cost visibility but never counted
  against a customer's include or invoiced.
- **Not instrumented** — Mailbox (inbound volume is sender-controlled and small:
  ~7M rows in September 2026), UserMeter (enforcement bookkeeping, ~10M),
  RepoSessionIndex, RepoSession, McpClientHub, and MCP session DOs. Their cost
  shows only in Cloudflare account analytics. Instrument one by recording its
  cursor `rowsRead` through `recordDurableObjectPlatformRowsRead`.

Per-call rows-read points share the ~250 `writeDataPoint` per-invocation budget
with every other usage event, so they always go through the coalescer
(`queueDurableObjectRowsRead`) rather than writing one point per query.

### Durable Object duration: estimate vs bill

Cloudflare bills Durable Object duration on wall-clock time an object is active
and not hibernation-eligible, at 128 MB, against an account-wide include
(400,000 GB-s/month, then $12.50 per million GB-s). Kody has two per-user views
of it. Neither is an invoice line.

- **Cloudflare-measured (trustworthy, per object):** the hourly
  `durable_object_duration_attribution` lane (minute 20;
  `packages/worker/src/usage/durable-object-duration-attribution.ts`) reads
  Cloudflare GraphQL `durableObjectsPeriodicGroups.sum.activeTime` per
  `objectId` for yesterday and today (UTC). It rebuilds `idFromName` for every
  frozen per-user name (McpClientHub, RunLog, UserMeter, Mailbox,
  RepoSessionIndex, StripePlanRefresh by stable user id; StorageRunner and
  RepoSession from `user_storage_buckets`; PackageRealtimeSession from
  app-bearing `saved_packages`) and writes absolute daily rows to
  `durable_object_duration_daily`. It writes fleet totals and the attributed
  share to `durable_object_duration_coverage_daily`. Admin usage shows GB-s
  (active seconds × 0.128) and gross dollars at list.
- **Not attributed:** MCP session DOs (named by transport session), JobManager
  (lives on `kody-jobs`, no origin binding), repo sessions discarded before the
  lane runs, platform singletons, and objects beyond the top 10,000 by active
  time on a day (`truncated = 1` on the coverage row). These stay in the day's
  unattributed total; nothing is guessed. The day's total comes from
  Cloudflare's account-wide aggregate (a second, dimension-less group in the
  same query), so truncation never shrinks the denominator. A response with no
  matching account fails the lane rather than zeroing the day, a day with no
  objects yet (analytics lag) keeps its last write, and users whose deletion
  started after the owner snapshot get no rows.
- **Why it is an estimate:** the include and Cloudflare's rounding apply to the
  account total, isolate sharing does not change per-object billing, and
  analytics for the current day are partial until the next day's run.
- **RPC proxy (`durable_object_gb_seconds`):** caller-side StorageRunner RPC
  wall clock × 0.128. It misses time an object stays active without an RPC
  (sockets, alarms) and every other class. Keep it for burst shape only; use the
  Cloudflare-measured view for cost.

The lane uses the origin `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Account Analytics read, same as
the Analytics Engine SQL API) and fails the lane loudly if Cloudflare rejects
the query.

### `package_static_call`: statically imported package export calls

Static imports (`import fn from 'kody:@scope/pkg/export'`) are the default way
package code is reused, so calls through them are metered per call:

- **Metered unit:** one call of a function-valued export (named or default) that
  was statically imported from a saved package. Non-function exports pass
  through unwrapped; imports that are never called record nothing. `userId` is
  the user the host run executes as, `entityId` is the **callee** package id,
  `durationMs` is the wall time of the call (through settlement for async
  functions), and `outcome` is `error` iff the call threw or rejected — the
  error still propagates to the caller unchanged.
- **Provenance is bundler stamping, never sandbox strings.** The import
  rewriter's proxy module (`ensurePackageProxy` in
  `packages/worker/src/package-runtime/module-graph-import-rewriting.ts`) knows
  which saved package a `kody:@…` specifier resolved to and bakes that id into
  the generated proxy (`createMeteredPackageImportProxySource`), which wraps
  function exports with `__kodyMeterStaticPackageExport` from the virtual
  runtime module — the same stamping discipline as per-package
  `packageStorage()` routing. Root self-imports are not stamped (the run already
  records `package_export` for that package).
- **Host-side validation (trust model, stated honestly):** stamped ids ride in
  generated code, but that code still executes inside the sandbox realm, so a
  malicious module could forge reports. The host
  (`createPackageStaticCallMeterTools` in
  `packages/worker/src/usage/package-static-call-usage.ts`) only records events
  whose stamped id is in the bundle's **static** dependency package ids recorded
  at build time (`bundle.dependencies`) — a strict subset of the
  `packageStorage()` grant set, which additionally grants the run's own package
  id and dynamic-import dependencies, neither of which the bundler ever stamps
  into a metered proxy — and silently drops the rest with a debug log. Forgery
  can therefore at worst inflate counts for packages the bundle already
  statically depends on.
- **Delivery never blocks the call path.** Each call does one synchronous buffer
  push (capped at 200 events per run — Analytics Engine allows 250
  `writeDataPoint` calls per invocation, one per event, and the run's other
  usage events need headroom; overflow is dropped and the cap is enforced
  host-side too); the run wrapper in `runBundledModuleWithRegistry` flushes the
  buffer over a runtime bridge in batches at the end of the run, while the
  sandbox RPC dispatchers are still live — a fire-and-forget RPC per call would
  race dispatcher teardown and lose events. The awaited flush is bounded by a
  short timeout so a slow bridge never owns the run's tail latency, and it loops
  (bounded) so async calls that settle during an in-flight flush are still
  delivered; calls that have **not settled when the run's entrypoint finishes**
  (a promise the run never awaited) are not metered — metering never extends a
  run's lifetime, and such a dangling promise may never settle inside the
  sandbox at all. Flush failures are swallowed.
- **Coverage:** every surface that funnels through
  `runBundledModuleWithRegistry` (ad hoc execute with static `kody:@…` imports,
  saved-package invocations, and the job/workflow/service runs built on them).
  Package-app fetch handlers use a separate runtime bridge and do not bind the
  meter; the wrapper no-ops there.
- **Capacity note:** the 200-events-per-run cap shares the ~250
  `writeDataPoint`-per-invocation Analytics Engine budget with every other usage
  event in the same invocation — in particular `outbound_fetch`, which also
  scales per operation. A heavy run (many static calls **and** many gateway
  fetches) can exceed the budget and Analytics Engine silently drops the
  overflow points. The eventual fix is aggregation (coalescing per-callee
  counts/durations into fewer data points), not raising the cap.

### Nesting: metrics are independent, do not sum across types

Execution surfaces nest. A package job funnels through the bundled-module runner
and the sandbox executor, so it produces one `job_run` and one `package_export`.
It does **not** also emit `execute` — that metric is MCP `execute` tool work
only, matching `execute_calls_per_day` and `first_execute_at`. A bundled
execute-tool run that calls statically imported package exports still produces
one `package_static_call` per call **inside** that run's `execute` span. Each
metric answers its own question (`execute` is ad-hoc execute-tool volume;
`job_run` is job activity; `package_export` is saved-package entrypoints;
`package_static_call` is per-callee reuse). `dynamic_worker_day` is the
Cloudflare bill unit: one unique Dynamic Worker id per user per UTC day, on
every sandbox surface that creates a worker. `dynamic_worker_invoke` is the
observe-only reuse meter: one event per execute-sandbox LOADER evaluate,
including later claims of the same id on the same UTC day. Do not add it to
entitlements or fleet event-count rankings.
`PlanLimits.maxUniqueWorkerDaysPerMonth` is the public included allotment shown
on `/pricing`. It is not in `entitlementResources` and does not replace the hard
daily `execute` / `job_run` caps, or the public-ladder weekly execute and
outbound-fetch windows. `usageGet` and the account usage UI report this meter
(and Durable Object rows-read) with `whatCounts` / `howToReduce` so the include
is self-explanatory. When unique-worker-day pressure is hot (limit denial or
over 80%), those payloads also include a short `mechanic` line: meter name plus
what a unique worker day is. Agent-facing package docs do not repeat the cost
model; see [Platform efficiency](../../guides/platform-efficiency.md).

### Unique worker days by surface

Every `dynamic_worker_day` event carries a closed `surface` tag (Analytics
Engine blob6): `execute`, `job`, `package_export`, `workflow`, `subscription`,
`app_fetch`, `app_realtime`, `retriever`, `webhook`, or `unknown`.
`package_export` is the usage name for run-record surface `export`. Call sites
pass the mapped surface; `unknown` is only for a missing mapping. When the
registry does not own the run record (keyed package invocations, inline
workflows), callers pass `runSurface` so UWD is not inferred as
`package_export`.

D1 `usage_rollups` stay keyed by `(user_id, metric, month)` — the monthly total
is unchanged. Surface share is an Analytics Engine query. Hourly aggregation
does not write a second rollup dimension. Use
`buildUniqueWorkerDayBySurfaceQuery` in
`packages/worker/src/usage/aggregate-rollups.ts`:

```sql
SELECT
  if(blob6 = '', 'unknown', blob6) AS surface,
  sum(_sample_interval) AS unique_worker_days
FROM kody_usage_events
WHERE timestamp >= toDateTime('2026-09-01 00:00:00')
  AND timestamp < toDateTime('2026-10-01 00:00:00')
  AND blob2 = 'dynamic_worker_day'
GROUP BY surface
ORDER BY unique_worker_days DESC
```

Empty `blob6` means the event has no surface tag. Preview uses
`kody_usage_events_preview`. Execute share for the month is
`sumIf(_sample_interval, blob6 = 'execute') / sum(_sample_interval)` on that
same filter.

Ad hoc execute events may also carry `executeShape` on blob7
(`thin_single_export` | `thin_few_exports` | `glue`): a host-side best-effort
class of the caller-authored source string. It is not used for billing and is
not shown to agents. Unparseable source omits the field.

### Dynamic Worker reuse (hit vs miss)

Every execute-sandbox LOADER evaluate records `dynamic_worker_invoke` after
`claimDynamicWorkerDay`, including when the claim returns `created: false`.
`cacheReuse` is billing-aligned: `miss` on the first `(user, workerId, UTC day)`
claim, `hit` on later claims of that id the same day. The event also carries
`durationMs` (sandbox evaluate wall-clock), `codeChars` (total character length
of the module-graph text hashed into the id), `surface`, `executeShape` when the
run classified one, and `paramsChars` (character length of a key-sorted JSON
serialization of `params`; **0** when `params` is omitted, `null`, a non-object,
an array, or empty `{}` — not 2 from stringifying `{}`). Payloads never include
source, param keys or values, package names, or worker ids.

D1 `usage_rollups` for `dynamic_worker_invoke` is the monthly invoke count (and
summed duration). Hit rate and average `paramsChars` are Analytics Engine
queries. Use `buildDynamicWorkerInvokeReuseQuery` and
`buildDynamicWorkerReuseRatioQuery` in
`packages/worker/src/usage/aggregate-rollups.ts`:

```sql
SELECT
  if(blob8 = '', 'unknown', blob8) AS cache_reuse,
  if(blob6 = '', 'unknown', blob6) AS surface,
  sum(_sample_interval) AS invokes,
  sum(double1 * _sample_interval) / sum(_sample_interval) AS avg_duration_ms,
  sum(double4 * _sample_interval) / sum(_sample_interval) AS avg_code_chars,
  sum(double5 * _sample_interval) / sum(_sample_interval) AS avg_params_chars
FROM kody_usage_events
WHERE timestamp >= toDateTime('2026-09-01 00:00:00')
  AND timestamp < toDateTime('2026-10-01 00:00:00')
  AND blob2 = 'dynamic_worker_invoke'
GROUP BY cache_reuse, surface
ORDER BY invokes DESC
```

Fleet hit rate is
`sumIf(_sample_interval, blob8 = 'hit') / sum(_sample_interval)` on
`blob2 = 'dynamic_worker_invoke'`. Unique-day yield is
`dynamic_worker_day / dynamic_worker_invoke` (or `/ execute` for execute-tool
volume). Same-user same-graph executes that vary only `params` reuse one worker
id; execute-surface hit rate and unique-day yield are the fleet readouts for
that reuse.

APP_LOADER package-app isolates record UWD (`dynamic_worker_day`) when the
worker id is stable (`app_fetch` / `app_realtime`). They do not emit
`dynamic_worker_invoke`. One-off `APP_LOADER.load()` without a hashed id has no
worker id to claim and does not emit `dynamic_worker_day`.

### LOADER worker identity

`createStableDynamicWorkerId` in `packages/worker/src/mcp/dynamic-worker-id.ts`
mints the execute-sandbox worker id. The hash is the sandbox-contract version
(`dynamicWorkerCacheKeyVersion`, bumped only when the executor or identity
contract changes), the `LOADER` binding name, the acting `userId` and
`storageContext`, compatibility date/flags, the main module name, and the module
graph (agent code plus the generated executor harness).

Timeout, `allowOutboundFetch`, and the excluded fetch hostname are baked into
that harness text, so they are not hashed again. Execute `params`,
`packageContext`, live MCP connect/tool metadata, and the unstamped
`packageSecrets` binding (present only when that evaluate's package id is set)
arrive on `evaluate` RPC and are not part of the key: the same user and module
graph reuse one isolate when only those per-call values change. Deploy SHA
(`APP_COMMIT_SHA`), email, and other request-only `gatewayProps` fields are also
omitted, so a parent deploy remints ids only when the harness or module graph
actually changes.

`userId` and `storageContext` stay in the key because `LOADER.get` reuses the
first factory's WorkerCode for a given id, including the `KodyFetchGateway`
`globalOutbound` stub. Those props authorize outbound fetch, secrets, and quota,
so two users (or two storage contexts) with the same module graph still get
distinct ids. UWD metering stays `(userId, workerId, day)` via
`claimDynamicWorkerDay` and is independent of this hash.

When modules are not deterministically hashable, the id is a UUID and is not
reused. Hashable modules still produce a stable id when `userId` is null or
`APP_COMMIT_SHA` is unset.

The customer-facing monthly meters are unique worker days plus Durable Object
rows-read. Usage above the include debits a funded purchasable-Pro credit wallet
(`creditDebitRates`: $0.004 per unique worker day, $0.002 per million rows read)
in the hourly `usage_aggregation` lane, right after the rollup recompute. On an
empty purchasable-Pro wallet, the same rollups stop new execute, job, and
automation runs once either include is used up. Nobody is invoiced for overage.
See [Entitlements](./entitlements.md#prepaid-credits). Never add durations
across different `eventType` values — that double counts nested layers. Within
one `eventType`, each chokepoint records exactly one event per metered unit, so
sums are safe.

Admin usage and insights convert `dynamic_worker_day` counts to a **gross**
Cloudflare estimate (`unique days × $0.002`). The 1,000 included unique
worker-days per month are account-wide, so per-user dollars are not a net bill
share. Worker ids stay inside UserMeter and Analytics Engine `entityId`; account
export does not list them.

## Sinks

`recordUsage()` picks its sink by environment:

1. **Workers Analytics Engine is the write path in production and preview**
   (`USAGE_EVENTS` dataset binding, configured for the `production` and
   `preview` environments in `packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`). When the binding
   is present, each event is one non-blocking `writeDataPoint` call and nothing
   else — a per-event D1 upsert would serialize every metered request (execute,
   fetch, email, jobs, ...) on D1's single writer. Data point layout:
   - `indexes`: `[userId]`
   - `blobs`:
     `[userId, eventType, entityId ?? '', outcome, timestamp, surface ?? '', executeShape ?? '', cacheReuse ?? '', packageId ?? '']`
     (`surface` is blob6, `executeShape` is blob7, `cacheReuse` is blob8,
     `packageId` is blob9; all empty when unset). Empty `packageId` means Ad hoc
     for customer credit attribution on `/account/usage`
   - `doubles`:
     `[durationMs ?? 0, cpuMs ?? 0, bytes ?? 0, codeChars ?? 0, paramsChars ?? 0]`.
     Coalesced points (`coalescedCountUsageEventTypes`:
     `durable_object_gb_seconds`, `durable_object_rows_read`,
     `durable_object_platform_rows_read`) store the coalesced unit count in the
     third double instead of bytes so hourly rollups can recover `event_count`.
     `codeChars` is double4 (module-graph text length on
     `dynamic_worker_invoke`). `paramsChars` is double5 (key-sorted JSON length
     of evaluate `params`; **0** when `params` is omitted, `null`, a non-object,
     an array, or empty `{}`).

   Analytics Engine is the analysis store (sampling-tolerant, high cardinality).
   Do not build enforcement on it.

2. **D1 `usage_rollups` is a derived aggregate** (defined in
   `packages/worker/migrations/0001-squashed-init.sql`): per-user, per-metric,
   per-month counters:
   - key: `(user_id, metric, month)` where `metric` is the `eventType` and
     `month` is the UTC `YYYY-MM` prefix of the event timestamp
   - counters: `event_count`, `error_count`, `total_duration_ms`,
     `total_cpu_ms`, `total_bytes`

   In production/preview the rows are recomputed hourly by
   `aggregateUsageRollups` in `packages/worker/src/usage/aggregate-rollups.ts`
   (gated by `shouldRunUsageAggregationCron` in the scheduled handler).
   `kody-jobs` fires cron and forwards to origin `JobsHost`, which runs this
   lane: it queries the Analytics Engine SQL API for the current UTC month
   grouped by user and metric (weighting by `_sample_interval`, since Analytics
   Engine samples under load) and batch-upserts absolute values — an idempotent
   recompute, not increments. Analytics Engine retention (~90 days) always
   covers a full month, so month-to-date recompute is complete; prior months
   already in D1 stay untouched. Analytics Engine rejects the whole query
   (HTTP 422) when an `if()` mixes a `doubleN` branch with an Integer literal,
   so fallbacks in that query are Float literals (`1.0`, `0.0`);
   `aggregate-rollups.node.test.ts` guards this. The aggregation needs
   `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and no-ops with a debug
   log when either (or the `USAGE_EVENTS` binding) is missing.

   **Local-dev direct fallback:** when `USAGE_EVENTS` is absent (local dev,
   tests), `recordUsage` upserts `usage_rollups` directly per event, so local
   admin pages and workers-unit tests work without Analytics Engine access.

   The rollup is the cheap read path for month-to-date admin and cohort views:
   one point lookup per user, metric, and month.

## Agent package conversation uses

Separate from `usage_rollups`, D1 table `agent_package_conversation_uses` (also
defined in `0001-squashed-init.sql`) tracks **distinct conversations** in which
a signed-in user’s agents used a saved package via MCP `execute` (package-export
runs attributed to that execute call, plus static/dynamic `kody:@…` deps
attributed to that execute call’s `conversationId`).

- Key: `(user_id, package_id, conversation_id)` — upsert updates `last_used_at`;
  the same package in the same conversation counts once. Stored
  `conversation_id` values are SHA-256 hex digests of the MCP conversation id
  (cardinality only; not reversible to the raw id).
- MCP server instructions do **not** inject popularity rankings from this table.
- Writes are best-effort and never throw into the invoke path (same spirit as
  `recordUsage`). Do **not** widen `usage_rollups` for conversation cardinality.

Helpers live in `packages/worker/src/usage/agent-package-conversation-uses.ts`.

## Helper contract

```ts
import { recordUsage } from '#worker/usage/record-usage.ts'

await recordUsage(env, {
	userId,
	eventType: 'job_run',
	entityId: job.id,
	durationMs,
	outcome: execution.ok ? 'success' : 'error',
})
```

Guarantees and rules:

- `recordUsage` **never throws and never rejects.** Metering must not break the
  path it observes. Sink failures are logged at warn level; expected local-dev
  degradation is logged at debug level.
- Every recorded event also emits a `kody.usage.{eventType}` **trace span**
  (when Workers tracing is available) with `kody.user_id`, `kody.event_type`,
  `kody.outcome`, and the optional `kody.entity_id` / `kody.duration_ms` /
  `kody.bytes` attributes. It nests under the active platform span, so traces
  become searchable by user and feature with no chokepoint changes. Span
  emission follows the same never-throws contract.
- It accepts any object with optional `USAGE_EVENTS` / `APP_DB` bindings
  (`UsageEnv`), so the full `Env` can be passed directly.
- **Graceful degradation:** in local dev and tests where the Analytics Engine
  binding is not present, the event is logged via `console.debug` and upserted
  into `usage_rollups` directly; when `APP_DB` is missing (or the table does not
  exist), the rollup write is skipped with a debug log.
- If `userId` is empty, the event is skipped entirely. Callers on paths that can
  run without a user (for example anonymous gateway fetches) must guard with
  `if (userId)` and not invent placeholder ids.
- The returned promise resolves quickly (one `writeDataPoint`, or one D1 upsert
  in local dev). `await` it inline, or pass it to `ctx.waitUntil(...)` inside
  Durable Objects when the caller must not block.

## Recipe: instrumenting a new chokepoint

1. **Pick the metered unit.** One event per semantic unit (one run, one fetch,
   one send). If your chokepoint already funnels through an instrumented layer,
   that is fine — you are adding a new metric, not replacing one — but never
   record the same `eventType` twice for one unit.
2. **Add the `eventType`** to the `UsageEventType` union in
   `packages/worker/src/usage/record-usage.ts` if it does not exist, and add a
   row to the metric table in this document.
3. **Find the narrowest span** where you have all of: the `userId`, the entity
   id, the start time, and the outcome. Wrap it:

   ```ts
   const startedAtMs = Date.now()
   let outcome: 'success' | 'error' = 'success'
   try {
   	// existing work
   } catch (error) {
   	outcome = 'error'
   	throw error
   } finally {
   	if (userId) {
   		await recordUsage(env, {
   			userId,
   			eventType: 'my_metric',
   			entityId,
   			durationMs: Date.now() - startedAtMs,
   			outcome,
   		})
   	}
   }
   ```

   A result object that carries an `error` field (like `ExecuteResult`) counts
   as `outcome: 'error'` even when nothing throws.

4. **Populate optional fields when cheap.** `bytes` for transfer-shaped metrics,
   `cpuMs` only when the platform exposes it. Leave fields you cannot measure as
   `undefined` — do not approximate, and never use wall clock as CPU. Worker
   Loader CPU arrives through the `dynamic_worker_cpu` tail; other chokepoints
   (host-side execute, jobs, fetch gateway) have no per-call CPU API and leave
   `cpuMs` unset. Open-source workerd reports `cpuTime` 0, so real values only
   appear on deployed Workers.
5. **Do not change behavior.** No new throws, no altered return values, no added
   latency beyond the awaited write (use `ctx.waitUntil` in DOs if needed).
6. **Test it.** Pick the flavor with the
   [test flavor decision matrix](../testing-principles.md#test-flavor-decision-matrix).
   In `*.node.test.ts`, spy on the helper:

   ```ts
   const usageModule = await import('#worker/usage/record-usage.ts')
   const recordUsageSpy = vi
   	.spyOn(usageModule, 'recordUsage')
   	.mockResolvedValue(undefined)
   ```

   Assert one call per metered unit with the expected `userId`, `eventType`,
   `entityId`, and `outcome` for both a success and a failure path, then
   `recordUsageSpy.mockRestore()`. The exemplar is the usage test in
   `packages/worker/src/mcp/executor.node.test.ts`. For `*.workers.test.ts`
   suites with a real local D1, create the table with
   `ensureUsageRollupsTestSchema` from
   `packages/worker/src/usage/test-schema.ts` and assert on `usage_rollups` rows
   instead.

## Execute interpretable share (`q`)

Measurement-only Analytics Engine dataset for the share of MCP execute modules
that are interpretable pure glue (suitable for a hypothetical fixed-interpreter
tier). This is **not** a `recordUsage()` event and does not enter
`usage_rollups`. The classifier and write path live in
`packages/worker/src/mcp/execute-interpretable.ts`.

A module is the `q` numerator when it is pure orchestration over `kody.*` /
`kody:runtime` and has none of: `kody:@` package imports, bare npm imports,
`node:` builtins, ambient `fetch` / `createAuthenticatedFetch` /
`oauthClientCredentials`, computed `import(expr)`, or any other
non-`kody:runtime` specifier. Type-only imports are ignored. Unparseable source
is conservative (not interpretable). This is not an interpreter runtime.

Production dataset `kody_execute_interpretable_events` (preview:
`kody_execute_interpretable_events_preview`). Binding
`EXECUTE_INTERPRETABLE_EVENTS` on origin and platform (where MCP execute runs).
Schema:

| Field     | Value                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index1`  | `execute_interpretable_q` (shared sampling population)                                                                                                         |

No user, source, run, or request identity. Recording is a no-op without the
binding. Query with `sum(_sample_interval)`:

```sql
SELECT
  blob1 AS class,
  blob2 AS reason,
  SUM(_sample_interval) AS executes
FROM kody_execute_interpretable_events
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7' DAY
GROUP BY class, reason
ORDER BY executes DESC
```

`q = interpretable / total` from that grouping, or
`sumIf(_sample_interval, blob1 = 'interpretable') / sum(_sample_interval)`.

## MCP search duration

Measurement-only Analytics Engine dataset for MCP `search` wall clock and the
exclusive tiles that should sum to it. This is **not** a `recordUsage()` event,
does not enter `usage_rollups`, and is not a UWD surface. Search-scope and
memory retrievers already mint `dynamic_worker_day` with surface `retriever`.
The write path lives in `packages/worker/src/mcp/tools/search-observability.ts`.

Production dataset `kody_mcp_search_events` (preview:
`kody_mcp_search_events_preview`). Binding `MCP_SEARCH_EVENTS` on origin and
platform (where MCP search runs). Schema:

| Field     | Value                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `index1`  | `mcp_search` (shared sampling population) |
| `blob1`   | `success` or `failure`                    |
| `blob2`   | `list`, `entity`, or `entity-batch`       |
| `blob3`   | intent task name, or empty                |
| `blob4`   | `trimmed` or `intact`                     |
| `blob5`   | `offline` or `online`                     |

| `double8` | intent confidence (`-1` when unknown)     |
| `double9` | `trimmedMatchCount`                       |

No user, query, conversation, or request identity. Recording is a no-op without
the binding. Query with `_sample_interval` weights:

```sql
SELECT
  quantile(0.5)(double1) AS p50_ms,
  quantile(0.95)(double1) AS p95_ms,
  avg(double2) AS avg_unaccounted_ms,
  avg(double4) AS avg_waiting_ms,
  SUM(_sample_interval) AS calls
FROM kody_mcp_search_events
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1' HOUR
```

## Onboarding funnel

Best-effort Analytics Engine points for the signup-to-checkout funnel. Not a
`recordUsage()` event and not a UWD surface. First-seen stages also write the
matching `users.first_*_at` column so a repeat does not emit again. Recording
never throws and is a no-op without the binding.

Production dataset `kody_onboarding_funnel_events` (preview:
`kody_onboarding_funnel_events_preview`). Binding `ONBOARDING_FUNNEL_EVENTS` on
origin, platform, and runtime. Schema:

| Field     | Value                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index1`  | stable user id                                                    |
| `blob1`   | stage (`signup_started`, `first_search`, `checkout_completed`, …) |
| `blob2`   | MCP client family, sanitized waiting card id, or plan             |
| `blob3`   | `mcp_connect_failed` error class, otherwise empty                 |
| `blob4`   | sanitized OAuth client id (hostname when the id is a URL)         |
| `double1` | `1`                                                               |

No email, prompt, secret, or free-text error. `/admin/insights` reads unique
users per stage for 7 and 28 days with `count(DISTINCT index1)`. Those counts
are sampled, so they are a floor. Local dev and missing credentials render the
table empty.

```sql
SELECT
  blob1 AS stage,
  count(DISTINCT index1) AS users
FROM kody_onboarding_funnel_events
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7' DAY
GROUP BY stage
```

## Reading the data

- Analytics Engine: query the `kody_usage_events` dataset (SQL API) filtered by
  the `index1` user id; blob/double positions are listed above. Remember that
  Analytics Engine samples: count with `sum(_sample_interval)` and sum values
  with `sum(doubleN * _sample_interval)`. Coalesced points store their unit
  count (RPCs or rows read) in `double3`, so those metrics' `event_count` is
  `sum(if(double3 > 0, double3, 1.0) * _sample_interval)` and `total_bytes`
  stays 0.
- D1: `SELECT * FROM usage_rollups WHERE user_id = ?1 AND month = ?2` gives
  every metric for a user's month in one small scan.
- Admin usage drill-down (on the admin users page):
  `packages/worker/src/admin/user-usage-data.ts` caches its per-user rollup read
  model for ~5 minutes in `BUNDLE_ARTIFACTS_KV` via the `@epic-web/cachified`
  adapter in `packages/worker/src/kv-cachified.ts` (key prefix
  `derived-cache:v1:`), keyed by user id + current month, falling through to
  direct D1 queries when KV is unavailable. Usage is loaded for one selected
  account at a time, so admin reads stay O(1) per view as the user base grows.
- **Fleet visibility** (`/admin/insights`, loader in
  `packages/worker/src/admin/fleet-usage-insights.ts`): bounded SQL over
  `usage_rollups` for the current UTC month — top-10 combined runtime duration
  (execute + job_run + workflow_run), top-10 event counts (excluding
  observe-only `dynamic_worker_invoke` and Durable Object meters), per-metric
  duration leaders, and an entitlement-pressure panel that reuses
  `readAdminEntitlementConsumption` for the top ~15 users by those same customer
  event counts, passing each row's `users.entitlement_ladder` so legacy
  Standard/Pro is scored against `legacyPlanLimits`. Queries are
  `LIMIT`-bounded; entitlement reads run with modest concurrency.
- **Launch signals** (`/admin/insights`, loader in
  `packages/worker/src/admin/launch-signals.ts`): COUNT / GROUP BY over indexed
  `users` columns and `platform_feedback.status`. Rough MRR maps
  `users.stripe_price_id` through the known Standard/Pro catalog (public
  $12 /
  $120 and $49 / $480, plus retired list prices) and never calls Stripe
  or pages the user table. `plan`, `stripe_plan`, and overlay-aware
  `effectivePlan` stay separate so gift/referral Pro overlays do not look like
  paid MRR. Cost-vs-pay ranks the current month's top unique-worker-day
  consumers (bounded scan) and a Risk panel: catalog-paid accounts over list
  MRR, unpaid accounts at ≥$1 / 500 unique days (50% of the $2 / 1,000
  unique-day included-bucket alert), and Standard/Pro rows whose
  `stripe_price_id` is missing or not in the catalog. Free pennies, max, and
  `kentcdodds` are not tagged. Admin-role accounts stay out of the unpaid
  near-allotment warn bucket; catalog-paid admins over list MRR still appear as
  paid underwater. The 5-minute insights KV cache (`admin-insights:v11`) covers
  the assembled page; RunLog-derived charts come from the hourly RunLog KV
  snapshot.
- **Proactive alerts** (`usage_entitlement_alert` scheduled lane in
  `packages/worker/src/app/usage-entitlement-alerts.ts`): hourly sweep of the
  same ~15-user bound. Emits `fleet.entitlement.crossed` to admin-owned packages
  once when a swept account first crosses 80% or 100% of a plan-limit resource,
  when a non-admin account's combined execute, job_run, and workflow_run
  duration for the month first exceeds `fleetRuntimeDurationAlertThresholdMs`
  (24h), when a non-admin account's unique Dynamic Worker cost for the month
  first reaches the plan-aware threshold (Free
  $2 / 1,000 unique days, Standard
  $12, Pro $49), or when a non-admin account
  hits 100% of `execute_calls_per_day` on three of the last seven UTC days.
  Staying over the same threshold does not emit again. Admin-role dogfooding
  stays on `/admin/insights` rankings and can still appear as an entitlement
  crossing, but does not page the runtime-duration, unique-worker-cost, or
  repeated- execute signals. KV prefix `fleet-entitlement-crossing:v1` claims
  each crossing. Execute-cap trains also write `fleet-entitlement-hit:v1` day
  keys so a later drop below 100% the same day does not erase the count. Admin
  links in the payload are built with `joinAppUrl` so a trailing slash on
  `APP_BASE_URL` cannot produce `https://host//admin/…`. See
  [Admin events](../../guides/admin-events.md#fleetentitlementcrossed-admins).
- **Fleet package error rate** (same `usage_aggregation` hour): a second
  Analytics Engine SQL, not grouped by user, totals `package_export`,
  `package_static_call`, `job_run`, and `workflow_run` for the last completed
  hour vs the hour before and the last 24 hours vs the 24 hours before. The
  snapshot lives at the platform KV key `fleet-package-error-rate:v1` and feeds
  `/admin/insights`. When the combined rate rises past a volume floor, a third
  query ranks owners of recent-window errors. Shares use the anonymous window
  error total so a truncated owner sample cannot look like one account. One
  account at ≥80% of those errors, or three accounts together at ≥80%, is
  concentrated; otherwise the spike stays fleet-wide. A follow-up query then
  loads package ids only for the named owners. Kody still fans
  `fleet.package_error_rate.elevated` to admin-owned packages in every case.
  Concentrated payloads name usernames and package name leaves only. The KV
  cooldown key `ops-alert:fleet-package-error-rate:v1` suppresses repeat pages
  for six hours. The payload has no user ids, package UUIDs, emails, or error
  strings. See
  [Admin events](../../guides/admin-events.md#fleetpackageerrorrateelevated-admins).

## Usage campaign

The hourly `usage_entitlement_alert` lane also runs the usage-state lifecycle
campaign (`sendUserUsageCampaignEmails`). One campaign state per user. The
evaluator branches on activation stamps and live reads (paged distinct inbound
`clientId`s, enabled jobs / last job run, execute-rollup depth, Stripe paid,
stock entitlement pressure). It is not a fixed week-1/3 calendar drip.

| State                  | Mail                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VerifiedNoMcp`        | Connect-an-agent template, 2 sends max                                                                                                                   |
| `ConnectedNoPackage`   | Save-a-package template (personalized with `mcp_client_name` when set), 2 sends                                                                          |
| `PackagedSingleClient` | Second-agent / portability template, 1–2 sends. Trial CTA only while the 14-day Pro gift is unreceived (`describeSecondAgentStandardGift` status `none`) |
| `Activated`            | Campaign silence. After ≥7 days, one `advocate_referral_testimonial` mail if not already sent                                                            |
| `Cooling`              | One “home’s still here” poke, then terminal quiet                                                                                                        |
| `LimitAware`           | Campaign silence; entitlement-warning mail owns the nudge                                                                                                |
| `Paid`                 | Campaign silence except the same one-shot advocate mail (1 forever). Billing transactional still owns paid-plan mail                                     |

`last_active_at` does not bump on `job_run`. Enabled jobs and `last_run_at` are
read separately so a quiet interactive user with a live schedule stays
Activated. Cooling requires stale `last_active_at` plus no job activity. When
both of those stamps are missing, the newest of `first_saved_package_at` /
`first_mcp_connected_at` is the fallback — a missing `last_active_at` is not
treated as 21 days stale. A failed jobs list does not count as "no jobs":
Activated and Cooling rows stay put, and Cooling is not mailed. First
observation still uses the stamp-based quiet check so a quiet packaged user
seeds `Cooling` instead of a later event transition that would backfill the
poke. Once a user has been `Activated` or `Cooling`, they do not fall back to
`PackagedSingleClient` mail when strong-use or client count dips — recent
activity returns them to Activated silence. `ever_activated` survives LimitAware
and Paid so those silent states cannot erase that history. A LimitAware snapshot
that already shows two clients, a live job, or strong use sets the flag even
when the resolved state is still LimitAware, so leaving the cap after a later
dip does not become PackagedSingleClient mail. LimitAware from VerifiedNoMcp
without those signals still leaves the flag off. Cooling is one lifetime poke:
`cooling_terminal` is sticky, so a later re-entry does not retry send 1 or stall
the sweep.

The advocate mail is not a drip and does not reopen Activated or Paid campaign
caps (those stay 0). Eligibility is current `Activated` or `Paid`, tenure of
seven days from `first_activated_at` (or `entered_at` when that stamp is not set
yet), a live referral `shareUrl` (`/signup?ref=<username>` from
`referralSharePath`), and no prior `advocate_referral_testimonial` ledger row.
Seed origin does not block it after tenure; first observation still only
persists. Tips opt-out suppresses it. The CTA is the account's referral invite
link; the secondary action is `mailto:me@kentcdodds.com` (the existing
testimonial channel — the homepage carousel has no intake form).

First sweep of an existing user seeds the current state without mailing
(backfill is out of scope). Verify-time connect-agent mail is send 1 of
`VerifiedNoMcp` (`origin=event`). If that first mail fails closed, the verify
path still opens an event-origin row with `send_count` 0 so the hourly sweep can
retry after the normal first-send dwell instead of seeding the user permanently.
The campaign upsert keeps `MAX(send_count)` and the later `last_sent_at` when
the state is unchanged, and never downgrades `event` to `seed`, so a later sweep
persist cannot clobber that verify-time row. A real state change still resets
`send_count`. Later sends wait 24 hours after a transition and 5 days between
sends in the same state. The send ledger claim is `INSERT OR IGNORE` on
`(user_id, state, send_index)` and is released if the Cloudflare send fails or
unsubscribe-token minting fails (no footerless campaign mail). A lost claim race
does not persist a stale `send_count`. Kit is not part of this machine.

Campaign mail is the only surface gated by the **Kody tips** preference
(`user_tips_email_opt_outs`). Each campaign send includes an “Unsubscribe from
tips” footer and RFC `List-Unsubscribe` / `List-Unsubscribe-Post` one-click
headers. The signed `/unsubscribe/tips` route sets that stamp; transactional
verify, billing, and error-rate mail is never suppressed. Distinct inbound
client counts come from `loadInboundMcpConnectionState`. A failed grant listing
does not treat the count as 0: packaged users without Activated history hold
`PackagedSingleClient` and persist without sending, so a later successful
listing stays a seed instead of an event backfill. A failed execute-rollup read
does not treat depth as 0: the same packaged row persists without sending, so a
later successful read can still become Activated silence instead of second-agent
mail.
