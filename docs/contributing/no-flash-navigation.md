# No-flash navigation

Changing routes never clears the current page and never shows a loading state in
its place. The next page replaces the previous one in a single DOM commit,
already holding its data. This document describes the mechanism that makes that
the default and the one helper a route uses to stay on it.

## How a navigation works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
	participant U as User
	participant R as client-router
	participant L as route loader
	participant P as navigation-data slot
	participant C as route component

	U->>R: click same-origin link
	R->>L: loader(url) (intent prefetch may already be in flight)
	Note over R: previous page stays on screen<br/>NavigationProgress bar after 150ms
	L-->>R: payload
	R->>P: setPreloadedNavigationData(href, payload)
	R->>R: pushState + notify()
	R->>C: one re-render with the new href
	C->>P: createRouteData.read() consumes the payload
	C-->>U: previous article replaced in one commit
```

1. `packages/worker/client/client-router.tsx` intercepts the click and runs the
   destination's loader from `clientRouteLoaders`
   (`packages/worker/client/routes/index.tsx`) **before** it touches the URL.
   Hover, focus, and touch start that loader early (`intent-prefetch.ts`), and
   the lazy route chunk is warmed alongside it (`lazy-route.tsx`).
2. While the loader runs, nothing about the page changes. The only pending UI is
   the 3px `NavigationProgress` bar, and only when the navigation is still
   pending after 150ms.
3. The loader result is parked in the single-slot navigation store
   (`navigation-data.ts`), the URL is committed, and the tree re-renders once.
4. The route's `createRouteData(...).read(handle, currentHref)` consumes that
   slot (or the SSR-embedded payload on the first document) and returns
   `kind: 'ready'` with the new payload. The previous content and the new
   content are never on screen together and no intermediate state exists.

Persistent shells (`/account`, `/admin`, `/docs`) additionally skip the page
view transition so their rail does not re-animate. Same-package Repo / Files /
Settings hops and `/@username` chip and search (`q`) query changes skip it too —
`shouldUseViewTransition` in `client-router.tsx` owns those lists, and
`prefers-reduced-motion` disables transitions everywhere.

## Writing a route

Use `createRouteData` from `#client/route-data.tsx`. It owns consume-once of the
loader payload, the fallback fetch and its href latch, abort handling, and the
last-good payload the route keeps rendering while any fallback runs.

```tsx
import {
	createRouteData,
	renderRoutePendingStatus,
} from '#client/route-data.tsx'

export function ThingRoute(handle: Handle) {
	const thingData = createRouteData({
		key: 'thing', // AppLoaderData key returned by thingRouteLoader
		async load(href, signal) {
			const response = await fetch(apiHrefFor(href), { signal })
			if (response.status === 404) return null // -> kind: 'not-found'
			const payload = await readJson<ThingLoaderData>(response)
			if (!response.ok || !payload?.ok) throw new Error('Unable to load.') // -> 'error'
			return payload
		},
	})

	return () => {
		const currentHref = readCurrentRouterHref(handle)
		const snapshot = thingData.read(handle, currentHref)
		if (snapshot.kind === 'not-found') return <NotFound />
		if (snapshot.kind === 'error') return <LoadError />
		const thing = snapshot.data
		// Only the SPA cold path (no SSR payload, nothing loaded before) has
		// nothing to keep on screen.
		if (thing === null) return <p role="status">Loading…</p>
		const pending = snapshot.kind === 'pending'
		return (
			<article aria-busy={pending ? 'true' : undefined}>
				{pending ? renderRoutePendingStatus() : null}
				<h1>{thing.title}</h1>
			</article>
		)
	}
}
```

Snapshot meanings:

- `ready`: `data` describes the current location. This is every navigation on
  the happy path.
- `pending`: a fallback fetch for the current location is in flight. `data` is
  the last good payload — the previous page when `stale` is true — and the route
  keeps rendering it under `aria-busy` with the visually hidden
  `renderRoutePendingStatus()` live region so assistive tech hears the update
  without the layout moving. Fallback fetches happen when the router's loader
  failed, after a stale refresh (a form POST redirecting back to the same URL),
  or on a cold SPA mount without SSR data.
- `not-found` / `error`: the fallback fetch for the current location settled
  that way (`load` returned `null`, or threw — the thrown error is
  `snapshot.error`).

`load` may also return `routeDataRedirect('/login')` when the fetch answered
401: the route keeps its current content while the browser leaves for the login
document.

Register the component and its loader in
`packages/worker/client/routes/index.tsx` under the same `routePattern(...)`
key; the loader is what lets the router load-before-commit. Reuse one component
for sibling patterns (list and detail, `/docs` and `/docs/:slug`) so
remix/component keeps the instance and its last-good payload across the switch.

### Routes that own state (account, admin)

Account and admin pages hold forms, selections, and action feedback in their
closure and mutate that state from POST responses. They use the same helper and
apply a payload into that state when its identity changes:

```tsx
let appliedPayload: AccountJobsLoaderData | null = null
let appliedError: Error | null = null
const jobsData = createRouteData({
	key: 'accountJobs',
	locationKey: getDataLatchKey, // list and detail hrefs share one payload
	async load(href, signal) {
		const response = await fetch(buildJobsApiRequestUrl(href), { signal })
		if (response.status === 401) return routeDataRedirect('/login')
		const payload = await readJson<AccountJobsLoaderData>(response)
		if (!response.ok || !payload?.ok)
			throw new Error('Unable to load scheduled jobs.')
		return payload
	},
})

return () => {
	const currentHref = readCurrentRouterHref(handle)
	const snapshot = jobsData.read(handle, currentHref)
	if (snapshot.data && snapshot.data !== appliedPayload) {
		appliedPayload = snapshot.data
		applyPayload(snapshot.data)
	}
	if (snapshot.error && snapshot.error !== appliedError) {
		appliedError = snapshot.error
		setMessage(snapshot.error.message, 'error')
	}
	const pending = snapshot.kind === 'pending'
	return (
		<AccountManagementShell busy={pending && appliedPayload !== null}>
			{/* header, message, and the page — rendered from closure state */}
		</AccountManagementShell>
	)
}
```

- `AccountManagementShell busy` sets `aria-busy` and renders the hidden live
  region for every account/admin page in one place.
- Loaders that return several keys assemble them with a `consume(handle, href)`
  option instead of `key` (all-or-nothing: return `null` when a required key is
  missing so the fallback fetch loads the full set).
- `locationKey(href)` names which hrefs share one payload (a list page and its
  detail pages, filters that the payload ignores).
- `reload(handle, currentHref)` refetches the current location after a mutation
  the route wants to reconcile with the server; the current payload stays on
  screen under `pending` until the fresh one lands.
- A standalone "Loading…" paragraph is only correct when
  `appliedPayload === null` — nothing has ever rendered here.

## When a section is slow

Keep the ordering: make the loader faster, then cache it, then split the slow
part out. A slow section is not a reason to render the page early with a spinner
where content goes.

- **Speed**: the loader payload is what the navigation waits on. Trim it to what
  the route renders; move expensive derivations server-side.
- **Cache**: intent prefetch already starts the loader on hover/focus.
  `prefetchRouteHrefs` warms a list of destinations on render (the equivalent of
  `prefetch="render"`) for links the visitor is likely to click next.
  Destinations that share a **matcher** and not a payload (every `/docs/:slug`)
  must pass `{ independent: true }` — a shared warmup would attach one article
  JSON to every slug. The docs shell does that for every sidebar href after
  hydrate (`DocsNavPrefetch`).
- **Stream / defer**: when one region is genuinely slow and the rest is not,
  split it into its own loader key or a Remix `<Frame>` (see
  [frames](./frames.md)) with a `fallback` that reserves the region's height, so
  the stable chrome commits at once and only that region fills in later. Keep
  the region's box fixed so the fill-in does not shift layout.

## What the checks cover

- `packages/worker/client/route-data.node.test.ts` and
  `route-load-latch.node.test.ts` pin the data-continuity contract: preloaded
  payloads are applied without a refetch, previous payloads stay while a
  fallback runs, aborted fetches re-arm, and late completions are dropped.
- `e2e/docs.spec.ts` and `e2e/account-navigation.spec.ts` observe `<main>`
  through guide-to-guide and account/admin section clicks
  (`e2e/main-transitions.ts`) and fail on any intermediate DOM state without an
  `<h1>`, any loading copy where content was, or a repeated request for a
  payload the router already loaded.
- `createRouteLoadLatch` is the helper's internal latch; client routes read
  through `createRouteData` and do not hand-roll load bookkeeping.
