# Dependency overrides

This file documents every `overrides` entry in the root `package.json` and
explains why it exists. `npm run overrides:check` (part of `npm run validate`
and the CI static job) fails when an override has no `###` heading here whose
first code span is the overridden package (nested overrides also name each
parent in backticks before the `→`), when a heading documents a package or
parent with no matching override, or when `package.json` repeats a key.

After changing overrides, `npm run audit:prod` is the production-dependency
check. It is part of `npm run validate` and the CI static job (see
[`checks`](./setup/checks.md) and
[`dependency auditing`](./setup/dependency-auditing.md)). Clearing these
override targets does not mean every advisory is gone — other transitive
packages can still report findings outside this file's scope.

## Production overrides

### `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` → `1.30.0`

The MCP SDK is pinned to a single version so that all workspaces resolve the
same copy. Without this override, npm may hoist conflicting versions from
transitive consumers (`agents`, `@kody/worker`). `agents@0.20.x` peers this
exact version.

### `hono` → `>=4.13.7 <5.0.0`

Keeps the transitive hono copy at or above the current advisory floor. Upstream
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.30.0` still declares `hono@^4.11.4`, which allows
vulnerable releases below `4.13.7`, so this override cannot be removed yet.

The floor is `4.13.7` for:

- [GHSA-hxh3-vqpv-xpqv](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hxh3-vqpv-xpqv) —
  `hono/jsx` renders plain strings unescaped in boundary components (`<4.13.7`)

That range also covers the `4.13.5` fixes:

- [GHSA-gqvv-2mrq-wpjv](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gqvv-2mrq-wpjv) —
  `toSSG()` can still write files outside the output directory (`<4.13.5`)
- [GHSA-g6gw-c38x-mqfc](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g6gw-c38x-mqfc) —
  unbounded dot-notation nesting in `parseBody()` (`<4.13.5`)
- [GHSA-crvj-82cr-hjcx](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-crvj-82cr-hjcx) —
  query parser reads parameters after the URL fragment (`<4.13.5`)

Earlier floors through `4.12.27` stay covered, including:

- [GHSA-hvrm-45r6-mjfj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hvrm-45r6-mjfj) —
  hono/jsx context not isolated per request (`>=4.11.8, <4.12.27`)
- [GHSA-w62v-xxxg-mg59](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w62v-xxxg-mg59) —
  server-side XSS via JSX escaping bypass in `cx()` (`>=4.0.0, <4.12.27`)
- [GHSA-xgm2-5f3f-mvvc](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xgm2-5f3f-mvvc) — API
  Gateway v1 adapter can drop a distinct repeated header value
  (`>=4.3.3, <4.12.27`)

The upper bound `<5.0.0` keeps the override within the same major version to
avoid breaking changes.

### `@hono/node-server` → `>=2.0.10 <3.0.0`

Keeps the transitive `@hono/node-server` copy at or above the current advisory
floor. Upstream `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.30.0` declares
`@hono/node-server@^1.19.9 || ^2.0.5`, which can still resolve a vulnerable 1.x
or a 2.x below `2.0.10`, so this override forces the patched 2.x floor and
cannot be removed yet.

Advisories requiring the 2.x floor:

- [GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9) —
  path traversal in `serve-static` on Windows via encoded backslash (`%5C`)
  (vulnerable `<2.0.5`, including all remaining 1.x releases)
- [GHSA-9mqv-5hh9-4cgg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9mqv-5hh9-4cgg) —
  follow-on 2.x issue (`>=2.0.0, <=2.0.9`, patched `2.0.10`)

The older 1.x floor (`>=1.19.13`) only addressed
[GHSA-92pp-h63x-v22m](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-92pp-h63x-v22m) and is
stale relative to the advisories above. The upper bound `<3.0.0` keeps the
override within the forced 2.x major.

### `postcss` → `>=8.5.10 <9.0.0`

Resolves a moderate advisory in postcss <8.5.10:

- [GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93) — XSS
  via unescaped `</style>` in CSS stringify output

PostCSS is pulled transitively by Vite (via `agents` / `vitest`). Upstream Vite
still declares `postcss@^8.5.8`, which allows `8.5.8` / `8.5.9`, so this
override cannot be removed yet even though a fresh resolve often lands on a
newer 8.5.x. No newer PostCSS advisory has raised the patched floor beyond
`8.5.10`. The upper bound `<9.0.0` keeps the override within the same major
version to avoid breaking changes.

### `ip-address` → `>=10.5.1 <11.0.0`

Keeps the transitive `ip-address` copy (via `express-rate-limit`) at or above
the current advisory floor. Upstream still declares `ip-address@^10.2.0`, which
allows `10.5.0`, so this override cannot be removed yet.

- [GHSA-rpw4-54j3-4h4q](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rpw4-54j3-4h4q) —
  `Address6.isLinkLocal()` recognizes `fe80::/64` rather than `fe80::/10`
  (`<=10.5.0`)
- [GHSA-2vr4-cq9g-pvrc](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2vr4-cq9g-pvrc) —
  `isPrivate()` misses NAT64 local-use `64:ff9b:1::/48` (`>=10.2.1, <=10.5.0`)

The upper bound `<11.0.0` keeps the override within the same major version.

### `fast-uri` → `>=3.1.8 <4.0.0`

Keeps the transitive `fast-uri` copy (via `ajv` from
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) at or above the current advisory floor. Upstream
still declares `fast-uri@^3.0.1`, which allows `3.1.7`, so this override cannot
be removed yet.

- [GHSA-hrr3-gc8f-f4qj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrr3-gc8f-f4qj) —
  inconsistent host case normalization via percent-encoded octets
  (`>=3.0.0, <=3.1.7`)

The upper bound `<4.0.0` keeps the override within the same major version.

### `proxy-addr` → `>=2.0.8 <3.0.0`

Keeps the transitive `proxy-addr` copy (via `express` from
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) at or above the current advisory floor. Upstream
`express@5.2.1` still declares `proxy-addr@^2.0.7`, which allows `2.0.7`, so
this override cannot be removed yet.

- [GHSA-jqcg-44mw-7w3h](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jqcg-44mw-7w3h) — IP
  spoofing via IPv4-mapped IPv6 trust subnet (`>=1.1.0, <2.0.8`)

The upper bound `<3.0.0` keeps the override within the same major version.

### `source-map-js` → `>=1.2.2 <2.0.0`

Keeps the transitive `source-map-js` copy (via Remix packages and PostCSS /
Vite) at or above the current advisory floor. Upstream Remix packages still
declare `source-map-js@^1.2.1`, which allows `1.2.1`, so this override cannot be
removed yet.

- [GHSA-68fv-2mgg-jv7q](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-68fv-2mgg-jv7q) —
  event-loop denial of service through indexed source-map section offsets
  (`>=1.0.0, <1.2.2`)

The upper bound `<2.0.0` keeps the override within the same major version.

### `smol-toml` → `>=1.9.0 <2.0.0`

Keeps the transitive `smol-toml` copy (via `@cloudflare/worker-bundler`) at or
above the current advisory floor. Upstream `@cloudflare/worker-bundler@0.2.5`
still declares `smol-toml@^1.7.2`, which allows `1.8.0`, so this override cannot
be removed yet.

- [GHSA-r4xh-jqrq-34v2](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r4xh-jqrq-34v2) —
  quadratic-time `parse()` from `parseKey` rescanning to end of document on each
  key line (`<=1.8.0`)

The upper bound `<2.0.0` keeps the override within the same major version.

### `undici` (under `wrangler` / `miniflare` / `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`) → `>=7.29.1 <8.0.0`

Floors only the Cloudflare 7.x undici copies. The root `undici@6.28.1` is
already on the 6.x patched line and must stay there.

- [GHSA-3wwx-pv8p-q78v](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3wwx-pv8p-q78v) —
  WebSocket permessage-deflate decompression can crash the process
  (`7.28.0`–`7.29.0`)

The upper bound `<8.0.0` keeps those tools on 7.x.

### `isomorphic-git` → `>=1.40.0 <1.40.8`

A compatibility cap, not an advisory floor. `isomorphic-git@1.40.8` and later
route `git.init` through a `mkdirp` that expects Node-style error codes, which
the `@cloudflare/shell` workspace filesystem does not set, so repo sessions fail
to initialize. Remove the cap once a newer release (or `@cloudflare/shell`)
handles those errors and repo-session tests pass against it.

### `zod` → `4.6.5`

Pins a single Zod copy across the workspace. Without this override,
`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers@0.22.0` (exact `zod@4.4.3`) and `@kody/worker`
(`zod@^4.6.5`) resolve two trees, and the Worker-local copy misses
`patches/zod+4.6.5.patch`, which trims `zod/v4/locales` to English-only and
strips unused `compile` / `fromJSONSchema` / `deepPartial` barrel exports for
the startup budget. Keep this pin aligned with the Worker Zod range and refresh
the patch when bumping.

## Development overrides

These packages are only reached through dev tooling, so `audit:prod` does not
cover them. The overrides still keep the local and CI toolchain off known
vulnerable releases.

### `brace-expansion` → `>=5.0.12 <6.0.0`

Keeps the `brace-expansion` copy (via `nx` and its `minimatch`) at or above the
current advisory floor. Upstream `nx@23.2.1` pins `brace-expansion@5.0.9`
exactly and `minimatch@10.2.5` declares `^5.0.5`, both of which allow vulnerable
releases, so this override cannot be removed yet.

The floor is `5.0.12` for:

- [GHSA-q2hr-2g5m-vwhr](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2hr-2g5m-vwhr) —
  quadratic-time expansion of the `{a},b}` rewrite (`<5.0.12`)
- [GHSA-qhr7-859c-m2p7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qhr7-859c-m2p7) —
  uncontrolled recursion on nested brace groups (`<5.0.11`)
- [GHSA-6j4f-fj2g-mc7p](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6j4f-fj2g-mc7p) —
  uncontrolled recursion in `parseCommaParts` (`<5.0.10`)

The upper bound `<6.0.0` keeps the override within the same major version.
