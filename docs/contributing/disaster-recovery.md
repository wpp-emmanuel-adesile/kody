Solo-operator runbook for Kody production data. One operator (Kent) owns
enablement, escrow, drills, and restore. The engineering invariants stay
fail-closed: immutable R2 objects, Ed25519-signed manifests, checked-in trust
registries populated only via code review, source/drill identity allowlists, D1
size ceilings, and drill-before-production-restore.

This document describes the designed end state. Treat every checklist item as
unproven until you have live evidence for that item (see the
[live evidence log](#live-evidence-log)). Code-complete packages are not proof
that the DR account, bucket locks, secrets, schedules, Access policy, or escrow
blob are live.

Primary operator surface:

- Admin UI on the backup control-plane Worker (Cloudflare Zero Trust Access +
  in-worker JWT verification) for dashboard, run-backup-now, seal-day, isolated
  restore drill, and graduated production restore.
- Offline CLIs under `tools/disaster-recovery/` when the UI is unavailable (see
  [Offline CLI fallback](#offline-cli-fallback)).
- Edge maintenance mode: `npm run maintenance-mode -- on|off|status` (see
  [Maintenance mode (edge)](#maintenance-mode-edge)).
- Destination provisioner: `node tools/ci/backup-resources-cli.ts plan|apply`.

Do not use `tools/export-d1-remote-to-sqlite.sh` as a backup or restore tool.

## Prevention

### Deploy guardrails

`npm run deploy-guardrails:check` protects the reviewed Durable Object migration
and binding baseline in `tools/ci/durable-object-baseline.json`. Every
`deleted_classes` migration must exactly match
`tools/ci/do-deletion-allowlist.json`; changing that allowlist is the explicit
code-review gate for destructive class deletion. The same check rejects removal
or renaming of protected `new_sqlite_classes` tags, changes to protected
Wrangler binding identities (`name`, `class_name`, `script_name`, or
`environment`), and destructive Cloudflare CLI deletion commands in GitHub
workflows unless the job is operator-triggered with `workflow_dispatch`.

## Live evidence log

First-proven dates for each lane (newest first). Re-prove and update after
material schema/storage/pipeline changes; a lane is only as trusted as its most
recent evidence.

The night ran out of window mid-`artifacts` (progress revision 714, no summary; 06:15 watchdog paged correctly). Recovery resumed the existing `exporter/progress.json` (no staged work purged), staged the ~20 remaining snapshots, wrote `exporter/summary.json` at 19:05:29Z, and the unchanged hourly control-plane seal picked the day up at 19:45.

Still unproven live: graduated production restore into the production database
(drill-level evidence only; it shares the `FixedLengthStream` upload path),
automated Mailbox re-import against a sealed day, and `weekly/` retention aging
through its lifecycle.

## Objectives

| Scope                         | RPO    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| All canonical stores          | 24h    | APP_DB, JOBS_DB, per-user Mailbox graphs, StorageRunner dumps, `EMAIL_BLOBS` / `COMMUNITY_ASSETS` blobs, published package/job source snapshots. `REPO_SESSION_BLOBS` is ephemeral session scratch and is not a canonical store. |
| APP_DB (`kody`)               | 24h    | Nightly control-plane D1 export; hourly size/ETag freshness; deep checksum via restore drill. Production size is ~117 MB — far below the 4.5 GB export ceiling (`BACKUP_MAX_SOURCE_BYTES`, not raisable above 4,500,000,000).    |
| JOBS_DB (`kody-jobs`)         | 24h    | Nightly control-plane D1 export of scheduled-job definitions (`jobs`) and `archived_job_artifacts`; hourly freshness; isolated drill via `--database kody-jobs`. Job definitions do not live in APP_DB.                          |
| Selected RunLog state         | 24h    | Never-pruned job observability, package-run success counters, and activation milestones; run history and correctness ledgers remain excluded                                                                                     |
| D1 freshness (both databases) | hourly | Control-plane size/ETag freshness for every configured source; deep checksum via drill                                                                                                                                           |

RTO is whatever the operator can achieve with the UI restore workflow after a
successful sealed-day drill. There is no provider-level cross-store atomic
snapshot.

Retention (UTC):

- `daily/` — ~35 days (immutable lock + lifecycle)
- `weekly/` — ~400 days (Sunday UTC D1 exports under `weekly/d1/...`)
- `blobs/sha256/` — long-retention content-addressed store shared across days
- Failed or incomplete sets never replace a sealed day

## Architecture

Two cooperating writers share one locked bucket in the independently
administered **DR (“KCD”) Cloudflare account**:

```text
Production worker (source account)          Backup control plane (DR account)
───────────────────────────────             ────────────────────────────────
Nightly */5 ticks 00:30–06:10 UTC           02:15 UTC: D1 export Workflow
  stage Mailbox / selected RunLog state       (one instance per configured D1:
  / StorageRunner / R2 / artifacts      →    APP_DB and JOBS_DB)
  into staging/{day}/...                    Hourly: D1 freshness + catch-up
Daytime */15 ticks: staging catch-up        Hourly: seal complete days
  resume oldest stranded day (≤14 days)     Admin UI: drill / production restore
06:15 UTC: staging watchdog → Sentry
```

### What intentionally lives on the DR (KCD) account

The DR (“KCD”) Cloudflare account (`a41d50ecaf0ae0f86dd1824ef6729cb2`) is the
old pre-migration production account, kept as the independently administered DR
destination. Production runs on the Kody account
(`a99ee2e72728dd52902ef288b7b1447d`). Future account cleanups must not delete
the kody-named resources below — they are intentional cross-account leftovers.

**DR / backup stack (this runbook):**

- Worker `kody-production-d1-backups` (hourly + nightly crons)
- Workflows `kody-production-d1-backup`, `kody-production-dr-restore`, and
  `kody-production-seal-day`
- Locked R2 bucket `kody-production-backups`
- Custom domain `kody-dr.kentcdodds.com`

**Personal journaling package data** (not platform infrastructure; reached via
API tokens from Kent's personal Kody packages, not Worker bindings):

- D1 `kody-journals`
- Vectorize index `kody-journals`
- R2 buckets `kody-journals` and `kody-journals-backup`

**AI Gateway `kody`** — still used by personal package jobs against that
account's Workers AI. The platform's own `AI_GATEWAY_ID` routes through the
same-named gateway on the production (Kody) account via the Workers AI binding,
which is account-scoped; the two gateways are independent.

A 2026-07-29 cleanup ([#656](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kody/issues/656);
[full audit and deletion record](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kody/issues/656#issuecomment-5122327193))
removed the last orphaned platform leftovers on the KCD account (stale
`kody-capabilities-prod` / `kody-capabilities-preview` Vectorize indexes; the
old production workers, KV namespaces, preview D1, and the `heykody.dev` zone
were already gone or moved).

### Capture lanes

1. **D1 (control plane)** — Dedicated Worker/Workflow in
   `packages/backup-control-plane/` calls the production-account D1 export API
   with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Account D1 Edit) for every entry in
   `SOURCE_DATABASES`: APP_DB (`kody`, `SOURCE_DATABASE_ID`) and JOBS_DB
   (`kody-jobs`). Each database gets its own Workflow instance
   (`d1-backup-<databaseId>-<day>`) and objects under
   `<tier>/d1/<database-uuid>/<day>/`. The signed schema-v2 manifest records
   that database's id, name, SQL byte count, and sha256. Restore drills sample
   table counts after import; the manifest itself does not store row counts.
   `SOURCE_DATABASE_ID` / `SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME` remain the primary APP_DB
   identity (full-manifest `d1ManifestKey` and typed production-restore
   confirmation). When `SOURCE_DATABASES` is unset, the control plane exports
   only that primary database. Gates: `ENABLE_PRODUCTION_D1_BACKUPS` and
   `BACKUP_BENCHMARK_APPROVED` must both be exactly `"true"`. Schedule stays
   inert otherwise. The production `kody-jobs` UUID is the live D1 named
   `kody-jobs`; deploy resolves it by name in
   `tools/ci/jobs-worker-resources.ts` (`jobs_d1_database_id`).
2. **Other canonical stores (production worker)** — When
   `DR_EXPORT_ENABLED=true` and DR S3 credentials are set, nightly ticks
   (`packages/worker/src/dr/exporter.ts`) stage:
   - **Mailbox** — owner inventory from D1 `users.stable_user_id`, with one
     keyset-paged `Mailbox.exportMailbox` NDJSON dump per owner and a
     checksummed mailbox index. Mailbox is the sole authority for USER email
     threads, messages, attachments, and delivery-event metadata; raw MIME and
     external attachment bytes remain in `EMAIL_BLOBS` and are captured by the
     R2 lane.
   - **Selected RunLog state** — the same owner inventory, with `exportRuns`
     started at its `job-run-observability:` cursor so only the never-pruned
     `job_run_observability`, `package_run_successes`, and
     `activation_milestones` tables are staged. Retained run/log history,
     invocation-ledger rows, and workflow projections are deliberately skipped.
   - **StorageRunner** — platform-wide inventory from D1, NDJSON dump per
     storage identity via `exportStorage`
   - **R2** — `EMAIL_BLOBS` and `COMMUNITY_ASSETS` listed and copied into
     `blobs/sha256/{hash}` with per-bucket NDJSON indexes (objects above 25 MiB
     are skipped with a warning in the staging summary; the same summary also
     warns when a `StorageRunner` dump exceeds the 16 MiB buffer ceiling and is
     skipped — review dashboard warnings before treating a sealed day as
     complete). An object whose key, size, ETag, and uploaded timestamp match
     the latest retained sealed-day index reuses that index entry and
     content-addressed blob without downloading or hashing the source object.
     Missing, malformed, or checksum-mismatched sealed indexes fall back to the
     full download and hash path.
   - **Published artifacts** — `BUNDLE_ARTIFACTS_KV` published source snapshots
     for rows in `entity_sources` with a `published_commit`
   - **Stranded-day catch-up** — a night with more staging work than the
     00:30–06:10 window can hold ends with `exporter/progress.json` but no
     `exporter/summary.json` (a _stranded day_; first hit live on 2026-08-07).
     Outside the nightly window, every 5-minute worker cron tick scans today
     plus the previous 14 days for progress-without-summary and resumes the
     oldest stranded day under the normal ~20 s budget and progress lease until
     its summary is written, so earlier days finish and seal before today's
     catch-up consumes the daytime budget. The 14-day lookback is sized above
     the observed ~2.5–3 day finish time for ~500 Mailbox owners so a day cannot
     age out mid-phase (live failure: 2026-09-12..2026-09-22 under the old 2-day
     lookback). Catch-up is resume-only: a day that never staged progress is not
     started fresh (its dumps would contain current data, not that day's). Data
     staged during catch-up is read at resume time; a slightly newer dump is
     preferred over an unsealable day.
   - **Resumable phase state** — `exporter/progress.json` contains phase
     cursors, counters, bounded index-entry tails, and conditional-write
     revision data. Mailbox, selected RunLog, and StorageRunner dump pages plus
     all phase index entries are written under `exporter/chunks/` as bounded
     NDJSON objects. Finalization reads those chunks and emits the stable
     mailbox, RunLog, storage, R2, and artifact index contracts referenced by
     `exporter/summary.json`. Chunk objects are content-addressed linked lists
     whose head keys and counts live in progress. Stale writers can therefore
     leave only unreferenced chunks; they cannot overwrite chunks selected by a
     newer lease. Progress updates retain `If-Match` ownership semantics.
     Canonical per-day dumps, indexes, and the completion summary are
     create-only; a resumed writer adopts an already completed object instead of
     replacing it. Per-owner Mailbox and RunLog dumps use the same 16 MiB
     admission ceiling and summary-warning behavior as StorageRunner dumps.
3. **Seal** — Control plane verifies staged checksums against
   `staging/{day}/exporter/summary.json`, requires a verified same-day D1
   manifest for every configured source (APP_DB and JOBS_DB) when sealing a new
   day, copies staged files under `daily/full/{day}/...`, and signs a
   full-backup manifest (`packages/shared/src/backup-full-manifest.ts`). New
   seals record every configured D1 under optional payload `d1Sources`.
   Historical days without `d1Sources` (schema-v1 and earlier schema-v2 mailbox
   seals) stay restorable as APP_DB-only. Already-sealed days short-circuit
   before source checks, so hourly seal does not treat them as incomplete when a
   later-configured database is absent. The sealed full-manifest `d1ManifestKey`
   still points at the primary APP_DB export. Hourly freshness also attempts to
   seal the last sixteen complete days synchronously. The UI seal action
   enqueues workflow `kody-production-seal-day` for that day and returns
   immediately.

### Restore-safe row sizes

D1's import path rejects individual SQL statements above its ~100 KB
statement-length limit (`statement too long: SQLITE_TOOBIG`), and D1 exports
write one INSERT per row — so a single oversized row makes the whole D1 backup
un-importable. This is not hypothetical: drills of the 2026-07-26 production
export failed on oversized `package_invocations.response_json` rows until the
rows were bounded.

- Write paths bound large text columns via
  `packages/shared/src/backup-restore-safety.ts` (64 KiB per column):
  package-invocation replay caches are dropped when oversized, and stored email
  bodies are truncated (raw MIME in R2 stays canonical). Large payloads belong
  in durable storage.
- The control plane measures statement lengths while streaming every export and
  writes `<objectKey>.stats.json` beside the SQL. A nonzero
  `oversizedStatementCount` logs `backup-unrestorable-statements` (failure
  status): the backup completes, but treat that day as unrestorable via the
  import API and fix the offending write path.

`TRUSTED_RESTORE_BASELINE_SHA256` is the SHA-256 of the JSON array of sorted
migration filenames at the deployment commit; recompute when adding a migration:

```sh
node -e "const fs=require('node:fs'),{createHash}=require('node:crypto');console.log(createHash('sha256').update(JSON.stringify(fs.readdirSync('packages/worker/migrations').filter(f=>f.endsWith('.sql')).sort())).digest('hex'))"
```

### Derived and accepted-loss stores

Restore rebuilds the derived stores below; do not treat them as recovery media:

- Vectorize (`CAPABILITY_VECTOR_INDEX`) — reindex with
  `POST /__maintenance/reindex-capabilities` `{ "force": true }` (omit `phases`
  so every kind rebuilds; follow `cursor` until `complete`). D1 restore includes
  `vector_embed_fingerprints`; without `force`, matching hashes skip Vectorize
  upserts.
- OAuth KV / browser sessions / provider tokens — users reconnect
- Queues, Workflow instances, Durable Object alarms — recreate from config + D1
  (`JobManager` alarms rebuild from restored `JOBS_DB`)
- Derived community icons and ordinary KV caches
- **UserMeter** — daily entitlement counters self-prune and can be
  re-established by traffic; authoritative storage-byte state is corrected by
  the revision-guarded physical-storage reconciliation lane. Losing UserMeter
  state can temporarily undercount usage, but it does not lose stored user
  content; this is accepted rather than adding a nightly UserMeter dump lane.
- **RunLog run history** — per-user runs and console lines have ~30-day
  self-enforced retention and remain accepted observability loss. Account
  export/deletion still cover them for user-facing portability and purge.
  Nightly DR starts `exportRuns` at `job-run-observability:` and therefore
  captures only job observability, package-run success counters, and activation
  milestones.

  **Known risk — keyed invocation idempotency ledger:** the same `RunLog` DO
  also holds the keyed package-invocation idempotency ledger (claims + 90-day
  terminal replay responses). There is no D1 `package_invocations` table; the DO
  is the only store. Losing the DO therefore loses idempotency/replay state, not
  just observability: webhook providers and other keyed callers that retry
  deliveries would **re-execute** invocations whose keys were already terminal,
  and in-flight replays would return fresh executions instead of stored
  responses. This is accepted with eyes open: lost rows are gone — later traffic
  re-establishes claims only for keys used after the loss, it does not restore
  protection for keys used before it. The blast radius is duplicate side effects
  (a loss of correctness state) bounded by the 90-day retention window; no
  stored user content is lost. The DO ledger is not part of DR media, and D1
  backups do not carry any invocation ledger.

- **RunLog workflow projections** — correctness projections are also before the
  selective export cursor and remain excluded. Incident handling must treat
  in-flight workflow state as lost and restart or reconcile affected workflows.
- **`AUDIT_DB`** — the separate D1 database containing hashed security audit
  events with 180-day retention has no cross-account backup lane. This is
  **accepted-unprotected** operator/security evidence, not user content
  (confirmed 2026-08-07): losing the retained audit trail in a DR account-loss
  event is acceptable; new events accumulate again after restore. Revisit only
  if forensics retention across account loss becomes a requirement. Scheduled
  job definitions live in `JOBS_DB` (`kody-jobs`) and are part of the nightly D1
  export; APP_DB does not store them.

### Honest gaps

- **Artifacts Git history** is not mirrored. Only published source snapshots in
  `BUNDLE_ARTIFACTS_KV` are staged. Full repo history is not restorable from
  backup media.
- **Unpublished / in-progress repo-session work** is not exported.
- **Mailbox restore is a separate post-D1 step.** Staging and sealing protect
  the authoritative graph and verify every owner dump against the mailbox index.
  Graduated D1/StorageRunner/R2/artifact restore does not import Mailbox rows;
  with ingress disabled, run
  [Automated Mailbox re-import](#automated-mailbox-re-import) (or the
  [manual fallback](#manual-mailbox-re-import-fallback)) and require
  `"done": true` plus `"verified": true` before re-enabling ingress.
- **StorageRunner restore is replace-per-bucket** (`importStorage` mode
  `replace`): each inventoried storage id is cleared and rewritten from the
  sealed dump. Storage ids absent from the inventory are not deleted by restore.
- R2 restore puts sealed objects back by key; it does not sweep orphans that
  appeared after the sealed day.
- **StorageRunner inventory** unions authoritative sources: `jobs` and
  `archived_job_artifacts` storage ids from the jobs worker (`JOBS_DB` via the
  `JOBS` / `JobsStore` path), plus `APP_DB` `user_storage_buckets` (including
  ad-hoc / execute buckets). Buckets known only inside a user's `RunLog` (and
  never registered in `user_storage_buckets` or an entity table) remain outside
  DR inventory by design; the selective RunLog lane does not export
  run-associated storage ids.

## Credentials and Access

No single credential should both erase production and erase the retained backup.

Admin UI auth is dual-layer:

1. Cloudflare Zero Trust Access in front of the control-plane Worker (policy
   pinned to `me@kentcdodds.com`).
2. In-worker verification of `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` against the team JWKS,
   requiring `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN`, `ACCESS_APP_AUD`, and `ACCESS_ALLOWED_EMAIL`
   (same allowlisted address). Mutating POSTs also require
   `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`.

The control-plane Worker deploys to the DR account from GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` → `deploy-backup-control-plane`) using
`DR_DEPLOY_TOKEN`, when `packages/backup-control-plane/` or shared backup
contracts change on `main` inside the 15-commit path-filter lookback (or on
manual `workflow_dispatch`). A longer Validate gap can skip that job while
`main` still has the change; dispatch Deploy on current `main` HEAD to force it.
Local Wrangler against the DR account remains available for emergencies
(`npm run backup:deploy`). Production restore requires the DR Worker to hold the
production-account D1 token as above; Access + JWT guard every UI action that
could use it.

## Secret escrow

`SECRET_STORE_KEY` is the AES-GCM KEK for saved secrets in D1. Restoring D1
without the exact key makes ciphertext unreadable. The plaintext key lives in
GitHub Actions secrets and the deployed production Worker; it must also be
recoverable if those are lost.

Escrow model (solo):

1. Operator passphrase lives only in the personal password manager (also stored
   as GitHub secret `SECRET_ESCROW_PASSPHRASE` for the seal workflow).
2. Manual `workflow_dispatch` of `.github/workflows/dr-escrow.yml` seals the key
   with PBKDF2-SHA-256 (600k iterations) + AES-256-GCM and uploads
   `escrow/secret-store-key.v1.json` to the DR bucket
   (`tools/disaster-recovery/seal-escrow.ts`). The escrow object is write-once;
   after a `SECRET_STORE_KEY` rotation, bump `ESCROW_KEY_VERSION` (for example
   `v2`) when re-sealing — see [Secret rotation](./secret-rotation.md).
3. Dashboard presence does not prove that the passphrase recovers the key. Copy
   the sealed blob to an offline environment and run:

   ```sh
   node tools/disaster-recovery/unseal-escrow.ts \
     --input /secure/input/secret-store-key.v1.json \
     --output /secure/output/secret-store-key
   ```

   The tool reads `SECRET_ESCROW_PASSPHRASE` or prompts without echo. It creates
   the output with mode `0600`, refuses repository paths and existing files, and
   emits no secret metadata. The output parent directory must already exist.
   `ESCROW_INPUT_PATH` and `ESCROW_OUTPUT_PATH` are the environment equivalents
   of the two flags. Omit `--output` only when writing the recovered key
   directly to stdout is intentional. To read from the DR bucket instead of a
   local file, omit `--input`, set the DR bucket credentials, and select the
   sealed object with `ESCROW_KEY_VERSION` (default `v1`).

Never put the plaintext key or passphrase in manifests, tickets, logs, or the
backup SQL. See [Secret rotation](./secret-rotation.md).

## Admin UI

### Isolated restore drill

Creates `kody-dr-drill-{day}-{hex}` in `DRILL_ACCOUNT_ID` (must differ from
`SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID`), imports one selected database's signed D1 SQL (UI
`database` select, or CLI `--database kody` / `--database kody-jobs`), runs
`PRAGMA quick_check`, samples table counts, then deletes the drill database on
success (keeps it on failure for inspection). The CLI points `migrations_dir` at
`packages/worker/migrations` for APP_DB and `packages/jobs-worker/migrations`
for `kody-jobs`. This path does not restore StorageRunner/R2/artifacts into
production. Run the drill once per database when proving a sealed day.

D1 remote import enforces foreign keys while applying `CREATE TABLE`, but
Cloudflare exports are not topologically ordered. Before upload, the control
plane verifies the unmodified SQL MD5 against the signed manifest R2 ETag, then
prefixes `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;` and uses the prepared body's MD5 for the D1
import init/ingest etag. Without that prelude, drills fail with errors like
`no such table: main.users`.

### Graduated production restore

1. **Prepare** — sealed full manifest + D1 manifest signatures must verify; UI
   shows SQL key/bytes/sha256 and a short-lived confirm token.
2. **Execute** — operator types the exact primary production database name
   (`SOURCE_DATABASE_NAME`, APP_DB `kody`); Workflow
   `kody-production-dr-restore` restores the databases that sealed day's
   manifest declares. Days without `d1Sources` restore APP_DB only and record
   `JOBS_DB: not present in this backup day` as a restore note, not a warning,
   so the Workflow instance completes. Days that list `d1Sources` restore every
   listed database. Before any production write, restore HEADs every required
   SQL object for existence and size, then streams each body through a SHA-256
   digest and discards it so SQL is not retained in memory. It then
   safety-exports each target and imports JOBS_DB (when listed) before APP_DB by
   streaming one database at a time via the Cloudflare API, then loops chunked
   `POST {PRIMARY_WORKER_ORIGIN}/__maintenance/dr-restore` with
   `Authorization: Bearer {DR_RESTORE_SECRET}` until the production worker
   reports `done` (StorageRunner replace, R2 put, published snapshot KV put).
3. **Mailbox re-import** — with ingress still disabled, run the automated
   Mailbox importer below for the intended owners. Do not re-enable ingress
   unless its final response has both `"done": true` and `"verified": true`.

Put the app in [maintenance mode (edge)](#maintenance-mode-edge) before execute.
After restore: reindex Vectorize (`POST /__maintenance/reindex-capabilities`
with `{ "force": true }`, omit `phases`, follow `cursor` until `complete`); let
`kody-jobs` re-arm JobManager Durable Object alarms from restored `JOBS_DB`
(`jobs.next_run_at` via `JobManager.syncAlarm` and the jobs-worker watchdog —
APP_DB is not the job schedule store); recreate queues from Wrangler config; and
expect users to reauthorize OAuth and reconnect MCP servers.

### Durable Object point-in-time recovery

Use Durable Object (DO) PITR for an application bug or corruption inside one
**surviving** SQLite-backed object. It restores that object's complete SQLite
database, including SQL tables and key-value storage, to an approximate point
within Cloudflare's rolling 30-day history. It is not a replacement for sealed
backups: if an object or its class was deleted, use backup media where that
class is covered. Deleting a Durable Object class destroys its PITR history and
makes this procedure impossible.

The operator endpoint is production-only infrastructure, is not registered on
user, MCP, or package surfaces, and reuses `DR_RESTORE_SECRET`. Put the app in
[maintenance mode (edge)](#maintenance-mode-edge) or otherwise stop writes to
the affected user before recovery. Supply the user's exact `stable_user_id`, not
username, email, or a D1 numeric id. Valid `kind` values are `mailbox`,
`run-log`, `user-meter`, and `storage-runner`; `storage-runner` also requires
its exact storage id.

1. Resolve a bookmark for the incident timestamp. Cloudflare returns the
   bookmark nearest that time:

   ```sh
   USER_ID='EXACT_STABLE_USER_ID'
   INCIDENT_AT='YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'
   INCIDENT_TIMESTAMP_MS="$(
     node -e 'const ms=Date.parse(process.argv[1]);if(!Number.isFinite(ms))process.exit(1);console.log(ms)' \
       "$INCIDENT_AT"
   )"
   curl --fail-with-body \
     --request POST "$PRIMARY_WORKER_ORIGIN/__maintenance/do-pitr" \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $DR_RESTORE_SECRET" \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data @- <<JSON
     {
       "operation": "get-recovery-bookmark",
       "kind": "mailbox",
       "userId": "$USER_ID",
       "timestampMs": $INCIDENT_TIMESTAMP_MS
     }
   JSON
   ```

   For StorageRunner, add `"storageId": "EXACT_STORAGE_ID"`. Keep the returned
   `bookmark` in the incident record and inspect it before the destructive step.

2. Schedule the restore. The object logs the undo bookmark as a structured
   `do-pitr-restore-scheduled` event, returns it as `undoBookmark`, and resets
   immediately so the next object session applies the restore:

   ```sh
   BOOKMARK='BOOKMARK_FROM_STEP_1'
   curl --fail-with-body \
     --request POST "$PRIMARY_WORKER_ORIGIN/__maintenance/do-pitr" \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer $DR_RESTORE_SECRET" \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data @- <<JSON
     {
       "operation": "restore-to-bookmark",
       "kind": "mailbox",
       "userId": "$USER_ID",
       "bookmark": "$BOOKMARK"
     }
   JSON
   ```

   Copy `undoBookmark` immediately and verify the affected object's state before
   restoring ingress. The operator log (`event=do-pitr-operator-restore`)
   includes the operation id, exact object identity, target bookmark, and undo
   bookmark. PITR is unavailable in local development and Workers unit-test
   emulation; the endpoint reports `pitr-unavailable` there.

3. To undo the recovery, repeat step 2 against the same exact object identity,
   using the saved `undoBookmark` as `bookmark`. The undo itself returns a new
   undo bookmark; retain that handle too. Do not assume logs from the restored
   object's own historical storage contain the handle—the structured platform
   log and the operator response are the recovery record.

### Automated Mailbox re-import

`POST /__maintenance/dr-mailbox-import` is the normal recovery path after
object/class/account loss. It is `DR_RESTORE_SECRET`-gated, verifies the sealed
full-manifest signature, verifies the mailbox index bytes and SHA-256, and
verifies each selected owner dump's bytes and SHA-256 before writing that owner.
Each tick writes parent threads, then messages with attachments through
`upsertMessageGraph`, then delivery events through `upsertDeliveryEvents`.
Returned cursors are authenticated and bound to the day, owner selection,
conflict policy, and drill flag; repeat the same request with `cursor` until
`done`.

Keep ingress disabled and complete the signed D1 plus R2 restore first. Select
specific stable owner ids with an array, or explicitly select every index owner
with `"all-from-index"`:

```sh
set -euo pipefail

DAY='YYYY-MM-DD'
CURSOR=''
while :; do
  BODY="$(
    DAY="$DAY" CURSOR="$CURSOR" node -e '
      const body = {
        day: process.env.DAY,
        owners: "all-from-index",
        conflictPolicy: "refuse",
      }
      if (process.env.CURSOR) body.cursor = process.env.CURSOR
      process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(body))
    '
  )"
  if ! RESPONSE="$(
    curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
      --request POST "$PRIMARY_WORKER_ORIGIN/__maintenance/dr-mailbox-import" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer $DR_RESTORE_SECRET" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data "$BODY"
  )"; then
    printf 'mailbox import request failed; stopping\n%s\n' "$RESPONSE" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  printf '%s\n' "$RESPONSE"
  DONE="$(node -e 'const x=JSON.parse(process.argv[1]);process.stdout.write(String(x.done===true))' "$RESPONSE")"
  if [ "$DONE" = true ]; then
    break
  fi
  if ! CURSOR="$(node -e 'const x=JSON.parse(process.argv[1]);if(!x.nextCursor)process.exit(1);process.stdout.write(x.nextCursor)' "$RESPONSE")"; then
    printf 'response is not done and has no nextCursor; stopping\n' >&2
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

The default conflict policy refuses an owner whose target Mailbox is non-empty.
Destructive replacement requires both `"conflictPolicy": "replace"` and the
separate exact confirmation
`"replaceConfirmation": "PURGE NON-EMPTY TARGET MAILBOXES"`. The importer never
calls `purge` without both. Review that change to the request as a destructive
restore step; keep the same fields on every resumed request. Before purging a
non-empty target, the importer first replays and count-verifies the complete
dump through a reserved scratch preflight object. Preflight and drill writes do
not arm normal Mailbox alarms; a verified production target is finalized only
after count parity succeeds.

For a drill, use explicit owner ids and add `"drill": true`. The importer
derives reserved scratch owner ids under `__mailbox-drill__:` and rewrites only
owner-bound blob references for those scratch objects; it never opens the real
owners' Mailbox objects. A successful drill still verifies the signed media,
exercises every graph upsert, and requires per-kind `countMailbox` parity. Drill
objects are inert test data and do not imply that their rewritten blob keys
exist. After collecting the per-kind count result, the importer atomically
purges all imported mail rows and retains only a non-sensitive count marker for
idempotent replay; cleanup failure fails the operation so a full mail copy
cannot be left silently. Use the same separately confirmed replace policy only
when recovering a scratch object left by an interrupted older run.

Every completed owner appears in `ownerResults` with expected and actual thread,
message, attachment, and delivery-event counts. Any mismatch leaves
`"verified": false` and is also reported in `warnings`; this operation never
enables ingress. Once target writes begin, normal Mailbox reads remain blocked
until count parity finalizes that owner; a failed or mismatched owner stays
blocked for safe operator recovery. Preserve all responses in the incident
record.

### Manual Mailbox re-import (fallback)

Prefer
[Durable Object point-in-time recovery](#durable-object-point-in-time-recovery)
when the Mailbox object survives and the target is still inside Cloudflare's
30-day history. If the automated importer is unavailable, use this procedure as
the correctness spec and incident-only fallback:

1. Keep ingress disabled and complete the signed D1 plus R2 restore first, so
   every raw MIME and external-attachment key referenced by Mailbox rows exists.
2. Verify the full-manifest signature and the sealed mailbox-index byte count
   and SHA-256. For every owner entry, verify the NDJSON object's byte count and
   SHA-256 before reading any rows. Do not mutate production during a manual
   drill.
3. Build and review an incident-only maintenance command from the restored
   commit. For each `ownerId`, stream that owner's dump into a new or confirmed
   empty `Mailbox` object. Recreate threads and messages with their attachments
   through `upsertMessageGraph`, then delivery events through
   `upsertDeliveryEvents`. Preserve the exported ids and timestamps, process
   parents before children, and never call `purge` on an existing object without
   a separately reviewed destructive-restore plan.
4. Compare `countMailbox` with the dump's per-kind counts, then spot-check
   inbound raw MIME and external attachments through normal reads. Re-enable
   ingress only after every intended owner passes.

## Schedules and freshness

| When (UTC)                      | Who               | What                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `*/5` during 00:30–06:10        | Production worker | Stage Mailbox, selected RunLog state, and other non-D1 stores for the current UTC day (cheap no-op once complete)              |
| Every 5 min outside 00:30–06:10 | Production worker | Staging catch-up: resume the oldest stranded day (progress without summary, today − ≤14 days); cheap no-op otherwise           |
| 06:15                           | Production worker | Staging watchdog: a missing `exporter/summary.json` for today, or an earlier stranded day, fails the lane → Sentry             |
| 02:15                           | Control plane     | Primary D1 export Workflow per configured database (APP_DB and JOBS_DB)                                                        |
| 02:45–05:45 hourly              | Control plane     | Catch-up create/restart of same-day D1 Workflows                                                                               |
| Hourly `:45`                    | Control plane     | D1 freshness for every configured source (identity, size ceiling, manifest age ≤26h, R2 size/ETag) + seal recent complete days |

### Stranded staging days (manual finish)

Failure mode: the nightly exporter hard-stops when the window closes, so a night
with too much work leaves `staging/{day}/exporter/progress.json` without
`exporter/summary.json`. The 06:15 watchdog pages; without a summary the day can
never seal. Daytime catch-up ticks (table above) normally finish the day
automatically within a day or two at steady state. When more than one day in the
lookback is stranded, catch-up finishes the oldest first so earlier days seal
before today's ticks consume the daytime budget. The hourly control-plane seal
(16-day lookback, matched to catch-up plus overnight gap) then seals it — no
operator action needed.

Operate manually when catch-up is stuck, the day has already fallen outside the
catch-up lookback, or you want the day finished immediately:

```sh
DAY='YYYY-MM-DD'
curl --fail-with-body \
  --request POST "$PRIMARY_WORKER_ORIGIN/__maintenance/dr-export" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $DR_RESTORE_SECRET" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{\"day\": \"$DAY\"}"
```

Each request runs up to 5 resume ticks (`maxTicks`, 1–10) with the normal ~20 s
budget and lease semantics, so it is safe alongside scheduled catch-up ticks.
Repeat until the response reports `"summaryWritten": true` (or
`"reason": "already-complete"`). The endpoint is resume-only: a day with no
staged progress returns `"reason": "no-staged-progress"` instead of starting a
fresh export for a past day. After the summary exists, the next hourly
control-plane seal covers the day if it is within the 16-day seal lookback;
otherwise seal it from the admin UI (`POST /actions/seal-day`).

From Kody MCP `execute`, pass `"maxTicks": 1` and loop until `summaryWritten` or
`already-complete`. Each tick can use the full ~20 s export budget; `maxTicks`
2+ holds the MCP request open past the client timeout (~60 s). Shell `curl` can
keep the default of 5.

Hourly freshness does not SHA-256 the SQL bytes; drills do. Page yourself on
`freshness-unrestorable` (the SQL contains statements D1 cannot import),
`freshness-stale`, size-ceiling hits, missing manifests or required SQL stats,
seal failures, `backup-unrestorable-statements`, or unexpected disablement of
the enable gates. Unrestorable exports never receive a canonical day manifest;
catch-up retries can re-export the day after the oversized row or write path is
bounded. Older unrestorable days may already have canonical and full manifests;
immutable media is intentionally left unchanged, so freshness, dashboard, drill,
and production-restore gates remain essential until it ages out.

## Maintenance mode (edge)

Origin has no request-time maintenance flag. `/__maintenance/*` on the origin
worker is a secret-gated operator API, not a public maintenance page. Ingress is
disabled with a Cloudflare Single Redirect on the `kody.codes` zone so the
switch still works when the origin worker or D1 is the thing that is broken,
flips without a deploy, and adds no cost to the request hot path.

```sh
npm run maintenance-mode -- on
npm run maintenance-mode -- status
npm run maintenance-mode -- off
```

`node tools/maintenance-mode.ts <on|off|status>` is the same CLI. `--zone`
defaults to `kody.codes`. `--target` defaults to
`https://status.kody.codes/maintenance`. `--dry-run` prints the Rulesets API
calls without sending writes. `--json` prints machine-readable status.

The token is `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` with **Zone:Read** and Zone **"Single
Redirect" / Dynamic Redirect: Edit** on `kody.codes`. See
[Operator accounts](./operator-accounts.md). No CI token has the redirect scope;
do not widen an existing token. The first live `on` / `off` is an operator run
with a token that has that scope (`--dry-run` first). The CLI adds or patches
the `kody-maintenance-mode` rule; it does not `PUT` the whole phase entrypoint,
so other Single Redirects on the zone stay put.

What stays reachable on the apex:

- `GET /health` — external uptime check. The rule expression is an exact path
  match, so `/health/components` is redirected.
- `/__maintenance/*` — DR restore, reindex, PITR, and other operator endpoints
  must stay reachable while ingress is off.

Everything else on `kody.codes`, including `POST /webhooks/stripe`, is a 302 to
the status maintenance page (`preserve_query_string` false). Stripe retries on
3xx and 5xx, so redirecting the webhook is acceptable for the restore window; it
is not excluded.

The public copy lives on the status worker (`GET /maintenance`), which does not
depend on origin D1 or `kody.codes`.

Confirm:

```sh
curl -I https://kody.codes/
# 302 Location: https://status.kody.codes/maintenance
curl --fail --silent --show-error --header "Accept: application/json" \
  https://kody.codes/health
# 200 {"ok":true,...}
```

Turn it off with `npm run maintenance-mode -- off` (the rule stays in the zone
ruleset, disabled, so `status` can still report it). Confirm
`curl -I https://kody.codes/` is no longer a 302 to the maintenance page.

## Offline CLI fallback

The UI is the primary drill/restore path. Keep the CLIs for air-gapped or
UI-down recovery:

- `node tools/disaster-recovery/d1-restore-drill-cli.ts` — isolated D1 import
  against checked-in identity/baseline/manifest-key registries. Pass
  `--database kody` or `--database kody-jobs` to select the export.
- `node tools/disaster-recovery/canonical-readiness-cli.ts` — fail-closed
  readiness assessment from local Ed25519 evidence envelopes
- `node tools/disaster-recovery/seal-escrow.ts` — same seal used by
  `dr-escrow.yml` (also runnable locally with env vars)
- `node tools/disaster-recovery/unseal-escrow.ts` — authenticated recovery from
  a local sealed blob or the DR bucket; writes only to stdout or a new file
  outside the repository
- `node tools/maintenance-mode.ts` — edge maintenance mode (Cloudflare Single
  Redirect on `kody.codes`; see
  [Maintenance mode (edge)](#maintenance-mode-edge))

Details:
[`tools/disaster-recovery/readme.md`](../../tools/disaster-recovery/readme.md).
Trust registries are populated only by code review, and the guardrail test in
`restore-trust-and-verification.node.test.ts` pins their exact contents.
`trusted-d1-restore-identities.json` and
`trusted-backup-manifest-public-keys.json` carry the live reviewed production
identity, drill target, and manifest verifying key.
`trusted-restore-baselines.json` and `trusted-readiness-public-keys.json` remain
empty, which keeps CLI baseline verification and CLI readiness fail-closed
(**NOT READY**) — the UI drill and sealing flows are the primary operational
paths.

Known v1 restore-shape limits (documented, not bugs): R2 restore is put-only
(objects created after the backup day are not deleted by a restore), and the
`staging/{day}` → `daily/full/{day}` key layouts plus the `userId/storageId`
dump identity encoding are load-bearing for bucket lock and lifecycle rules —
changing them requires a reviewed migration of the bucket layout.

## Solo enablement checklist

Work top-to-bottom. Leave gates false until the matching gate item is done.

### 1. Accounts and destination

- [ ] DR Cloudflare account exists and is administered separately from
      production.
- [ ] Production source identities recorded: account id, APP_DB UUID/name
      (`kody`), JOBS_DB UUID/name (`kody-jobs`), Worker origin, R2 bucket names.
- [ ] Drill account id differs from production; recorded as `DRILL_ACCOUNT_ID`.
- [ ] Provisioner plan/apply creates the private DR bucket with `daily/` (35d)
      and `weekly/` (400d) lock/lifecycle rules; provisioner token never becomes
      a Worker secret.
- [ ] Checked-in CLI trust registries populated via code review when you want
      offline drills/readiness (optional if UI-only, recommended).

### 2. Manifest keys and Access

- [ ] Ed25519 manifest keypair generated; public SPKI + key id committed as
      reviewed vars; private PKCS#8 only as control-plane Worker secret.
- [ ] Trusted restore baseline id/digest vars match the checked-in baseline
      registry entry you intend to use.
- [ ] Zero Trust Access application fronts the control-plane hostname; policy
      allows only `me@kentcdodds.com`; `ACCESS_*` vars match that app.
- [ ] Control-plane secrets set: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`,
      `BACKUP_MANIFEST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PKCS8_BASE64`, `DRILL_API_TOKEN`,
      `RESTORE_CONFIRM_SECRET`, `DR_RESTORE_SECRET`.

### 3. Deploy control plane (still gated off)

- [ ] Placeholders in `packages/backup-control-plane/wrangler.jsonc` replaced;
      both enable vars remain `"false"`.
- [ ] `DR_DEPLOY_TOKEN` is set; optional R2-admin `DR_BACKUP_ADMIN_TOKEN`
      reconciles policy when accessible and logs a non-blocking skip otherwise;
      the control plane deploys to the DR account; `BACKUP_BUCKET` bound;
      Workflows `kody-production-d1-backup`, `kody-production-dr-restore`, and
      `kody-production-seal-day` present; public bucket access off.
- [ ] UI loads only through Access; unauthenticated and wrong-email JWTs
      get 403.

### 4. Production exporter wiring

- [ ] Production Worker vars/secrets: `DR_EXPORT_ENABLED` (leave unset/false
      until ready), `DR_BACKUP_ACCOUNT_ID`, `DR_BACKUP_BUCKET_NAME`,
      `DR_BACKUP_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `DR_BACKUP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`,
      `DR_RESTORE_SECRET` (same value as control plane).
- [ ] Control plane `PRIMARY_WORKER_ORIGIN` points at production.
- [ ] One manual/nightly staging run writes
      `staging/{day}/exporter/summary.json` with acceptable warnings; verify the
      mailbox and RunLog indexes and at least one referenced owner dump against
      the recorded byte count and SHA-256.

### 5. Benchmark and enable D1 schedule

- [ ] Controlled D1 export benchmark at production scale: unavailable time,
      bytes (~117 MB today), hashes, no overlap, download inside URL lifetime;
      live `file_size` strictly below 4.5 GB.
- [ ] Isolated UI drill (or CLI) passes `PRAGMA quick_check` for that export.
- [ ] Set `BACKUP_BENCHMARK_APPROVED` and `ENABLE_PRODUCTION_D1_BACKUPS` to
      `"true"` and redeploy control plane.
- [ ] Observe 02:15 enqueue, hourly freshness success, and first sealed day
      after staging completes.

### 6. Escrow and ongoing drills

- [x] `SECRET_ESCROW_PASSPHRASE` in password manager + GitHub secret; run
      `dr-escrow.yml`; dashboard shows escrow present; run
      `node tools/disaster-recovery/unseal-escrow.ts --input <sealed-blob> --output <secure-path>`
      against the sealed blob with the real passphrase, offline (proven
      2026-08-07 — see live evidence log /
      [#1091](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kody/issues/1091)).
- [ ] Set `DR_EXPORT_ENABLED=true` in production after staging path is proven.
- [ ] Monthly: UI isolated D1 drill on a retained day; confirm alert paths for
      freshness failures.
- [ ] Quarterly: seal verification + verify every Mailbox owner dump against its
      sealed index + spot-check StorageRunner/R2/artifact restore into a
      non-production target (or full UI production restore only during a real
      incident after a fresh drill on that day).
- [ ] After material schema/storage/encryption changes: extra drill before
      trusting the newest sealed day.

## Explicit exclusions

- Continuous replication, zero RPO, or cross-store atomic snapshots
- Live proof of deployment/locks/escrow merely because code exists
- D1 availability during export; non-destructive Time Travel clone
- D1 `file_size` ≥ 4.5 GB or any export/restore object ≥ 5 GiB (rejected)
- Multipart D1 capture / statement-safe split restore
- Full Artifacts Git history or unpublished repo-session work
- Backup of Vectorize, OAuth KV, queues, Workflow runtime, Durable Object alarms
  (JobManager rebuilds alarms from restored `JOBS_DB`; other DOs follow their
  own restore or accepted-loss paths)
- Backup of `RunLog` run records and logs (observability; ~30 day DO
  self-retention), invocation idempotency ledger, and workflow projections;
  never-pruned job observability and activation state are backed up
- Backup of UserMeter (reconciliation/restart is the accepted recovery path)
- Backup of `AUDIT_DB` hashed audit events (180-day evidence;
  accepted-unprotected 2026-08-07 — operator confirmed no backup lane for now)
- Plaintext `SECRET_STORE_KEY` or other credentials inside backup media
- Using `tools/export-d1-remote-to-sqlite.sh` as DR
