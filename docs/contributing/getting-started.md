# kody Setup

<!--
If you're an agent reading this, do as much as you can yourself and then
tell the user what else they need to do themselves.
-->

Use these steps to run `kody` locally and on Cloudflare Workers.

If you are here to understand the purpose of this repository rather than set it
up, read [`docs/contributing/project-intent.md`](./project-intent.md) first.
Some docs and parts of the repo structure reflect starter-oriented conventions,
and the project intent is to build a personal assistant with an MCP-first
architecture.

## Install dependencies

We use npm for installs and scripts, with Node 26 as the runtime.

```bash
npm install
```

To scaffold a **new** project from the epicflare template instead of working
inside this repo, run `npx create-epicflare`.

## Expectations and assumptions

The setup flow assumes:

- Node 26 and npm are installed.
- You run commands from the repo root (needs `nx.json`, `package.json`, and
  `packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`).
- **Cloudflare D1 and KV**: The checked-in
  [`packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`](../../packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc)
  declares bindings and `database_name` values but does **not** commit remote
  resource IDs (`database_id`, KV `id` / `preview_id`). Production and preview
  deploys run ensure scripts that create or resolve resources and write
  generated Wrangler configs with real IDs (see
  [`docs/contributing/setup/local-development.md`](./setup/local-development.md)).
  **Local development does not require** provisioning remote D1 or KV;
  `npm run dev` uses local Wrangler persistence.

See `docs/contributing/setup-manifest.md` for required resources and secrets.

For optional Cloudflare offerings (R2, Workers AI, AI Gateway, extra KV), see
`docs/contributing/cloudflare-offerings.md`.

## Preflight checks

Verify Node 26 and that dependencies are installed:

```bash
node --version   # expect v26.x
npm install
```

For deploy work, confirm Wrangler can reach your Cloudflare account:

```bash
npx wrangler whoami
```

## Quick Start (local only)

1. Copy the local environment file and adjust secrets if needed:

```bash
cp packages/worker/.env.example packages/worker/.env
```

`COOKIE_SECRET` and `SECRET_STORE_KEY` are required. The example file includes
placeholder values that work for local development.

2. Apply local D1 migrations:

```bash
npm run migrate:local
```

This writes `APP_DB`, `AUDIT_DB`, and `JOBS_DB` under `.wrangler/state` (the
directory `npm run dev` persists) and copies `packages/worker/.env` from
`.env.example` when the file is missing.

3. Start local development:

```bash
npm run dev:ensure
```

That reuses a healthy origin if one is already up, otherwise starts
`npm run dev`. Either way it prints the resolved URL (default port `3742`) once
`/health` is ok. For an interactive session, run `npm run dev` instead. Health
check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:<port>/health
```

## Full Cloudflare setup (deploy)

Local setup does not create Cloudflare resources. The checked-in Wrangler
template omits remote D1/KV IDs on purpose. The production deploy workflow runs
`node tools/ci/production-resources.ts ensure`, which creates missing D1/KV
resources when needed and writes
`packages/worker/wrangler-production.generated.json` with resolved IDs for that
deploy. Cloudflare deploys do not auto-create those resources from bindings
alone, so the workflow runs that ensure step before migrations/deploy.

1. Configure GitHub Actions secrets and variables for deploy:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Workers deploy + D1 edit + Workers KV Storage:Edit
  access on the correct account)
- `COOKIE_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` or similar)
- See `docs/contributing/setup-manifest.md` (`GitHub Actions configuration`) for
  full optional secrets/variables and where to get each value.

2. Deploy production through GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
   That workflow uploads `kody-platform`, `kody-runtime`, `kody-jobs`, and
   origin in the order documented in
   [architecture](architecture/index.md#production-worker-fleet).
   `npm run deploy` from a laptop uploads the **origin** script only
   (`packages/worker`); it is not a full production ship.

## Agent/CI setup

For non-interactive or automated setup:

1. Ensure `packages/worker/.env` exists. `npm run migrate:local` copies it from
   `.env.example` when it is missing.
2. Run migrations and the full validation gate:

```bash
npm run migrate:local
npm run validate
```

`npm run validate` is the single authoritative local gate. It runs format, lint,
typecheck, unit tests, Playwright E2E, MCP E2E, backup/status/nx-cache/jobs/
highlight/api/api-docs/runtime/platform dry-run builds, structure checks
(including `docs:check-no-hosted-execute`, `docs:check-file-refs`,
`skills-lock:check`, `slop-ratchet:check`, and `knip`), and the production
dependency audit (`audit:prod`) in parallel, then `worker-startup-time:check`.
CI runs the same checks as parallel jobs (node and workers unit suites on
separate runners).

To seed a deterministic test login after migrations:

```bash
node tools/seed-test-data.ts --local
```

Cloudflare resources are managed during deploy. Deploy-time ensure steps inject
real D1/KV IDs into generated Wrangler configs (not into the checked-in
template).

## Local development

See
[`docs/contributing/setup/local-development.md`](./setup/local-development.md)
for local dev commands and
[`docs/contributing/setup/checks.md`](./setup/checks.md) for verification steps.

To create a deterministic test login after migrations, see
[`docs/contributing/setup/seeding.md`](./setup/seeding.md).

## Build and deploy

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy the origin script to Cloudflare (not the full four-script production
fleet — see [architecture](architecture/index.md#production-worker-fleet)):

```bash
npm run deploy
```
