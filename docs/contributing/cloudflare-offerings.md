# Cloudflare offerings (optional integrations)

kody binds a broad set of Cloudflare offerings. Origin
(`packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`) is the largest surface — D1 (`APP_DB`), KV
(`OAUTH_KV`, `BUNDLE_ARTIFACTS_KV`), **cross-script** Durable Object bindings
(`MCP_OBJECT` and others), R2 (`COMMUNITY_ASSETS`, `EMAIL_BLOBS`,
`REPO_SESSION_BLOBS`), Images (`IMAGES`), Workers AI (`AI`, optionally routed
through AI Gateway via `AI_GATEWAY_ID`), Vectorize (`CAPABILITY_VECTOR_INDEX`),
Queues, Analytics Engine (`USAGE_EVENTS`), Workflows, and worker loaders — but
it is not the whole inventory. Platform, runtime, and jobs wranglers
(`packages/platform-worker/wrangler.jsonc`,
`packages/runtime-worker/wrangler.jsonc`, `packages/jobs-worker/wrangler.jsonc`)
own Durable Object **classes**, `JOBS_DB`, and runtime-only bindings. See
[architecture](architecture/index.md#production-worker-fleet) and
[architecture/data-storage.md](./architecture/data-storage.md) before adding,
removing, or replacing a binding.

This guide covers how those common offerings are added, useful when you need
another one of:

- R2 (object storage)
- Images (resize / re-encode)
- Workers AI
- AI Gateway
- An additional KV namespace for app data (separate from `OAUTH_KV`)

All examples assume you are using this repo's `packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`
and that you run commands from the repo root.

## Authentication: `wrangler login` vs API tokens

For local, interactive development:

- Log in once with `npx wrangler login`
- Wrangler uses browser-based OAuth, and commands run as your user

For CI / GitHub Actions / automation:

- Create a Cloudflare API token and provide it as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- Prefer least-privilege, account-scoped tokens (avoid "All accounts")

### What token to make (permissions)

Cloudflare's API token UI changes over time, but the shape is stable:

- Token permissions are **Account** permissions (not Zone permissions)
- You grant **Read**/**Edit** per product area
- Wrangler deploys, creates resources, and sets secrets via the API token

Recommended baseline permissions for this repo:

- `Workers Scripts:Edit` (deploy, update, delete preview Workers)
- `Workers KV Storage:Edit` (OAuth/session KV)
- `D1:Edit` (migrations, database operations)
- `Workers Queues:Edit` (email delivery Queue, DLQ, and event subscription)

Add these permissions when you add the corresponding offering:

- R2: `R2 Storage:Edit`
- Workers AI: `Workers AI:Read` (for `wrangler ai models`; deploy uses Workers
  Scripts)
- AI Gateway (only if you want to manage gateways via API): `AI Gateway:Edit`

If you use `npx wrangler secret put ...` in CI, your token must also be able to
edit Worker secrets (covered by `Workers Scripts:Edit`).

## Images (resize / re-encode)

Use the Images binding for off-isolate raster transforms so a large upload
cannot OOM the Worker. Origin and platform wranglers bind `IMAGES`; package
icons and integration / MCP logos fit to 256px WebP at ingest.

### Token permissions

Images uses the Worker script binding. Deploy is covered by
`Workers Scripts:Edit`; there is no extra Images resource to create.

### Bindings (`packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`)

```jsonc
"images": { "binding": "IMAGES" }
```

Local wrangler and workers-unit tests use the offline Images simulator (`width`
/ `height` / `fit` / `format`). Wrangler does not inherit the `images` key into
named environments, so production, preview, and test each restate
`"images": { "binding": "IMAGES" }`. Node-unit tests use
`createFakeImagesBinding()` in
`packages/worker/src/test-support/images-binding.ts`.

## R2 (object storage)

Use R2 for file uploads, user-generated media, and other blob/object storage.

### Token permissions

- `R2 Storage:Edit` (for creating/listing buckets via Wrangler)

### Commands to create buckets

Create separate buckets for production vs preview/testing:

- `npx wrangler r2 bucket create <app-name>-uploads`
- `npx wrangler r2 bucket create <app-name>-uploads-preview`
- `npx wrangler r2 bucket list`

Wrangler can also update `packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc` for you:

- `npx wrangler r2 bucket create <app-name>-uploads --binding UPLOADS_BUCKET --env production --update-config`
- `npx wrangler r2 bucket create <app-name>-uploads-preview --binding UPLOADS_BUCKET --env preview --update-config`

### Bind the bucket in `packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`

Add an `r2_buckets` binding in each environment you want to use it:

- `env.production`: bind the production bucket
- `env.preview` / `env.test`: bind the preview bucket

Example (production):

```jsonc
"r2_buckets": [
  {
    "binding": "UPLOADS_BUCKET",
    "bucket_name": "<app-name>-uploads"
  }
],
```

Example (preview/test):

```jsonc
"r2_buckets": [
  {
    "binding": "UPLOADS_BUCKET",
    "bucket_name": "<app-name>-uploads-preview"
  }
],
```

### Local dev notes

`npm run dev` runs `wrangler dev --local`, so R2 is emulated locally. To hit
remote R2 from dev, run Wrangler with `--remote` (for example
`node ./wrangler-env.ts dev --remote`).

## Workers AI

Workers AI lets your Worker call Cloudflare-hosted AI models.

### Token permissions

- `Workers Scripts:Edit` (deploy)
- `Workers AI:Read` (optional; for `wrangler ai models`)

### Commands to explore models

- `npx wrangler ai models`
- `npx wrangler ai models --json`

### Bind Workers AI in `packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`

Add the AI binding per environment:

```jsonc
"ai": { "binding": "AI" }
```

If you want the `Ai` helper client, install it:

- `npm install @cloudflare/ai`

In your Worker code, you typically construct a client like:

```ts
import { Ai } from '@cloudflare/ai'

const ai = new Ai(env.AI)
```

## AI Gateway

AI Gateway provides analytics, caching, retries, and controls for calling
third-party AI providers (for example OpenAI or Anthropic) from your Worker.

### Token permissions

If you create/configure gateways via the dashboard, you do not need any extra
token permissions beyond what you already use to deploy Workers.

If you want to manage gateways via API automation, add:

- `AI Gateway:Edit`

### Create a gateway

There is no `wrangler` subcommand for AI Gateway in Wrangler v4. Create the
gateway in the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Cloudflare dashboard -> `AI` -> `AI Gateway`
2. Create a gateway and copy:
   - your `account_id`
   - the `gateway_id` you chose/received

### Commands to verify the gateway works

AI Gateway uses provider-specific upstream paths. For OpenAI-compatible traffic,
the URL looks like:

`https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account_id>/<gateway_id>/openai`

You can do a quick smoke test with curl (example uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`):

- `curl -sS "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/<account_id>/<gateway_id>/openai/v1/models" -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" | head`

### Using AI Gateway in app code

Most provider SDKs support overriding the base URL:

- Keep the provider API key as a Worker secret (for example `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Point the SDK's base URL at the gateway URL

## KV (app KV, separate from `OAUTH_KV`)

This repo already binds `OAUTH_KV` for OAuth/session state. Treat `OAUTH_KV` as
"owned" by `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`:

- Avoid mixing app data into `OAUTH_KV`
- Avoid key prefix collisions with the OAuth library
- Keep quotas/evictions isolated from auth state

### Token permissions

- `Workers KV Storage:Edit`

### Commands to create a second namespace

Create a dedicated namespace for app data, for example `APP_KV`:

- `npx wrangler kv namespace create <app-name>-app --binding APP_KV --env production --update-config`
- `npx wrangler kv namespace create <app-name>-app-preview --binding APP_KV --env production --preview --update-config`

If you are not using `--update-config`, record the namespace IDs and add them to
`packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc` manually (see next section).

### Bind the namespace in `packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`

Add a second entry in `kv_namespaces` alongside `OAUTH_KV`:

```jsonc
"kv_namespaces": [
  {
    "binding": "OAUTH_KV",
    "id": "<oauth-kv-id>",
    "preview_id": "<oauth-kv-preview-id>"
  },
  {
    "binding": "APP_KV",
    "id": "<app-kv-id>",
    "preview_id": "<app-kv-preview-id>"
  }
],
```

## If you want a higher-level AI integration

If you're looking for a higher-level way to integrate AI (streaming responses,
tool/function calling, typed outputs, and a clean client/server contract),
consider TanStack AI.

This repo is not a React app, so the main thing to know is: TanStack AI is
framework-agnostic at its core. You can use:

- `@tanstack/ai` on the server (Workers) to run models and tools
- `@tanstack/ai-client` in any UI (headless) to manage chat state + streaming

You only need the React/Solid packages if your UI framework benefits from their
hooks.

### Cloudflare integration: `@cloudflare/tanstack-ai`

Cloudflare maintains an official integration package that makes TanStack AI work
well with both:

- Workers AI (`env.AI` binding)
- AI Gateway (`env.AI.gateway("<gateway-id>")`)

It includes ready-to-use adapters for chat, image generation, transcription,
text-to-speech, and summarization for Workers AI models, plus AI Gateway routing
for OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini/Grok/OpenRouter. See:

- https://github.com/cloudflare/ai/tree/main/packages/tanstack-ai

#### Install

- `npm install @tanstack/ai @tanstack/ai-client @cloudflare/tanstack-ai`

If you want to route to third-party providers through AI Gateway, also install
the TanStack provider packages you use (for example OpenAI or Anthropic):

- `npm install @tanstack/ai-openai`
- `npm install @tanstack/ai-anthropic`

#### Bindings (`packages/worker/wrangler.jsonc`)

Add the Workers AI binding in each environment you want:

```jsonc
"ai": { "binding": "AI" }
```

Then your Worker receives `env.AI` at runtime.

#### Server-first usage (no React required)

TanStack AI supports multiple streaming formats. A common pattern is:

1. A Worker endpoint accepts `{ messages, conversationId? }` as JSON
2. Server runs `chat(...)` and returns a streaming `Response`
3. Your UI uses `@tanstack/ai-client` with either:
   - `fetchHttpStream("/api/chat")` (newline-delimited JSON), or
   - `fetchServerSentEvents("/api/chat")` (SSE)

Workers AI example (direct binding, no third-party API keys):

```ts
import { createWorkersAiChat } from '@cloudflare/tanstack-ai'
import { chat, toHttpResponse } from '@tanstack/ai'

const adapter = createWorkersAiChat('@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct', {
	binding: env.AI,
})

const stream = chat({
	adapter,
	stream: true,
	messages,
	conversationId,
})

return toHttpResponse(stream)
```

AI Gateway example (route OpenAI requests through your gateway):

```ts
import { createOpenAiChat } from '@cloudflare/tanstack-ai'
import { chat, toHttpResponse } from '@tanstack/ai'

const adapter = createOpenAiChat('gpt-4o', {
	binding: env.AI.gateway('my-gateway-id'),
	// Depending on your gateway mode, you may not need to pass an API key here.
	// apiKey: env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
})

const stream = chat({ adapter, stream: true, messages, conversationId })
return toHttpResponse(stream)
```

Client usage (headless, works with any UI toolkit) looks like:

```ts
import { ChatClient, fetchHttpStream } from '@tanstack/ai-client'

const client = new ChatClient({
	connection: fetchHttpStream('/api/chat'),
	onMessagesChange: (next) => {
		// Render however your app renders (not tied to React)
		console.log(next)
	},
})
```
