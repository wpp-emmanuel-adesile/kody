# Project intent

`kody` is an experiment in building a personal assistant that can work from any
AI agent host that supports MCP.

The core idea is to keep the public MCP surface small while making a large
number of capabilities available behind that surface. This repo follows
Cloudflare's Code Mode approach for execution: expose a tiny set of stable tools
such as `search` (capability discovery) and `execute` (sandboxed capability
calls), then implement the broader capability graph in code rather than as
hundreds of individually described MCP tools.

## What this repo is

This repository is:

- A working Cloudflare Workers application.
- A place to experiment with OAuth-protected MCP endpoints.
- A place to experiment with MCP apps, packages, and supporting infrastructure.
- The foundation for a personal assistant rather than a general-purpose SaaS
  product.

When docs or code reflect starter-oriented conventions and conflict with the
guidance here, treat this document as the project's intent.

## Who this is for

Kody is a multi-user personal assistant. Each authenticated user gets a strictly
isolated assistant: their own packages, jobs, secrets, memories, chat threads,
MCP servers, email inboxes, and durable storage. There is no shared state
between users.

- Optimization target: a high-quality personal assistant for each individual
  signed-in user, with hard isolation between users
- Onboarding: signup is open. Anyone can create an account from `/signup`. New
  signups must verify their email address; unverified accounts can sign in but
  cannot send outbound email. Person accounts that stay unverified for seven
  days are deleted, which releases the username, `{username}.kody.run`
  subdomain, `{username}@` mail local, and `stable_user_id`. There is still no
  privileged "primary user" at runtime.
- Tests and fixtures may seed deterministic local accounts, but seeded accounts
  are fixtures only and are not privileged at runtime

Optimize for:

- Per-user isolation as a first-class invariant, enforced at the storage,
  durable-object, vectorize, and runtime layers. Four narrow, documented
  exceptions exist: RBAC account administration (`access = 'any'`, limited to
  `user` and `role` entities), operator-owned system email for reserved platform
  addresses stored under `system:email`, attributed platform feedback that a
  user explicitly approved for role-gated admin review, and role-gated metadata
  about activity on deliberately public community listings. The community
  exception covers who forked or rated which listing and when, including rating
  scores, but never package source, rating notes, or unrelated user content. See
  [Authorization](./architecture/authorization.md).
- Fast iteration on the personal-assistant experience
- Interoperability across MCP-capable hosts

It does not need to optimize for:

- Per-organization tenancy or shared-team workspaces
- Fine-grained permission delegation between many distinct humans inside a
  single account
- Enterprise SSO / directory provisioning

## Product intent

This project is meant to:

1. Build a personal assistant that can be reached from MCP-capable AI agents.
2. Keep the MCP contract compact enough that it does not bloat host context.
3. Hide most capability complexity behind `search` for discovery and Code Mode
   `execute` for capability calls.
4. Treat ChatGPT as a likely primary integration target, while keeping the
   server usable from other MCP hosts when possible.

The emphasis is on portability of the assistant across hosts, not on shipping a
large host-specific app surface for each client.

## What not to assume

When working in this repo, do not assume:

- The example tools define the full MCP surface.
- This project should evolve into a large catalog of explicitly declared MCP
  tools.
- This project is trying to become a generic starter kit for others.
- This is a single-user system. Per-user isolation is an invariant, not a future
  direction; treat any code path that reads or writes data without a `userId`
  (or that shares a Durable Object id across users) as a bug. The intentional
  cross-user boundaries are RBAC account administration (`:any` on `user`/`role`
  only, behind explicit guards), operator-owned system email for reserved
  platform addresses, explicitly approved, attributed platform feedback exposed
  through role-gated admin review capabilities, and role-gated community
  activity metadata for public listings — see
  [Authorization](./architecture/authorization.md).
- One conversation or one agent per signed-in user. Concurrent chats and
  completely separate agents for the same user are expected. Do not key
  conversation-scoped behavior on the user alone, or on an MCP transport session
  or open connection. State that spans requests needs an explicit identifier the
  client actually passed — see MCP 2026-07-28 Statelessness and
  [0033](./decisions/0033-no-user-as-conversation.md).
- The main goal is enterprise-grade least-privilege design for many users.

Also do not document capabilities as if they already exist. Keep design notes
and proposals clearly labeled, and keep present-tense claims limited to behavior
that exists in the repository.

## Documentation guidance

When updating docs or explaining architecture:

- Describe the repo as a multi-user personal-assistant platform with strict
  per-user isolation, not a shared workspace product.
- Mention the per-user isolation invariant when it materially affects product,
  auth, or storage decisions.
- Keep present behavior separate from design notes and proposals.
- Prefer focused docs over expanding `AGENTS.md`.

## Agent guidance

If you are an agent working in this repo:

- Read this file before making product-level decisions.
- Per-user isolation is a hard invariant. Any new feature that touches data must
  be scoped by `userId` at the data layer, by user-namespaced Durable Object ids
  at the runtime layer, and by user-aware filters at the search/vector layer.
  Cross-user access requires an explicit guard and one of the documented narrow
  boundaries: account administration, operator-owned system email, user-approved
  platform feedback, or public-listing community activity metadata — see
  [Authorization](./architecture/authorization.md).
- Isolation between users is not the same as one conversation per user. The same
  signed-in user can run concurrent chats and completely separate agents at
  once. Do not hide or bind conversation-scoped context (memories, nudges,
  progressive disclosure) to the user id alone or to an MCP session.
- Avoid proposing a large static MCP tool catalog as the default direction.
- Keep interoperability with MCP hosts in mind, especially around compact tool
  surfaces and clear server instructions.
- Platform capabilities must stay **vendor-agnostic**. Do not add service-named
  types, handlers, or forks (`strava-hub`, `meta-hub`, `fooProviderVerify`, …)
  in platform schema or code. Express provider differences as knobs on a generic
  primitive (params/options + documented presets). See
  [0054](./decisions/0054-no-vendor-specific-platform-logic.md).
